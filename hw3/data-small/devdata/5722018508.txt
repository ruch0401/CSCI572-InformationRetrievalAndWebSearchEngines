"ROUNDUP is one of many in the United States, that serves as a gathering for real cowboys that have the unique ability to put their life experiences into the form of written poems and gather for a weekend of fun and entertainment for those that wish to experience this unique art form in live performance.Written on their web site at http://www.zekes.com/~kokopeli are these unattributed words: "Pardon me," but I suppose you might be wonderin' what all the fuss is, about a bunch of cowboys gettin' together to recite poetry,"The first time I went to hear 'em, I sure had my doubts that a cowpoke could really have much to say worth listenin' to, especially  having lived around 'em most of my life here in southern Arizona.

The paper proposed an organizational structure that would be more aggressive in raising money from private individuals and which could participate more fully in the electoral arena. The Confederation's organizing effort was seized by members of the field who wanted to make a fresh start and build a new organization from the ground up. Now, less than a year later, the CAA has been formed by members from the state's arts service organizations."explicitly political" and that will offer the field "an inclusive, encompassing" voice in Sacramento.  Kathy Lynch who has served as the Confederation's lobbyist for the past six years has been retained by the CAA thereby insuring, they believe, strong representation for the arts and historical continuity with the legislature.For much of its twenty years of service, the Confederation has had to defend the arts from budget cuts and narrow, often reactionary, thinking. "We were successful in maintaining the budget of the California Arts Council when other states like New York, Michigan, Texas, and Massachusetts sustained deep cuts or complete elimination," they state. "We sought to develop the public policy muscle of the arts overall and to bring our members into needed dialogue about artists' rights and cultural equity.....The result is that California's advocates for the arts are in a stronger position than their national counterparts to make significant gains in the next decade."A Library of Resources includes Periodicals; Reference books; Alumni contact files; Referral network; Grant and residency lists; Exhibition opportunities; Teaching resources; Resources for women artists and much more.They run a 6,000 square foot facility with a gallery, studios, library, school, and administrative offices.

A hot floor debate is expected when the bill is considered, which might be right after the Fourth of July break, according to the Post.  One of the dissenting Republicans, Rep. Michael P. Forbes (NY), called the vote "an outrage." The Post quotes Forbes as stating that "we will be working overtime to ensure that this funding is restored when this appropriations bill goes to conference with the Senate."The CDA made it a crime to use a computer to transmit indecent material to someone under 18 years old or to display such material "in a manner available" to a person under 18. Netly News reports that the decision makes it unlikely that any government-imposed restriction on Internet content would be upheld as long as the material has some intrinsic constitutional value.Stevens wrote that the court regarded the law's goal of protecting children from indecent material as legitimate and important, but concluded that the "Its breadth is wholly unprecedented.  The CDA's burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the Act's legitimate purposes."The decision was the court's first effort to extend the First Amendment into cyberspace.

Vending Ordinance as a way to harass street artists but are also, in many cases, inventing the law as they go.

"For years, the challenge for electronic artists has often been the overcoming of technological barriers and the pioneering of new media," they write. "Today, these same artists find themselves wrestling with the more perplexing questions of meaning, content, and social context.  Is the medium still the message?  How are computers shaping the languages of expression for our age?

The key issue is to keep the agency in the bill, and if possible to win an amendment to increase the amount in the House. That gives the Senate a chance to force the House to fund the agency."The American Symphony Orchestra League believes that if the NEA can be kept in the House bill, it will be possible for the Senate to approve $99.5 million (current level) and thus help force the House to come closer to this level in the House-Senate negotiations later this summer."Emergency action is required, says Arts-alert-usa.  "Please contact your representatives....to make sure that YOUR views are heard on the preservation and nurturing of our American culture and its institutions."The Times remarks on the "populist philosophy" that is permeating the new Getty Center's public facilities and programs. "Call it civic responsibility, noblesse oblige or a severe case of institutional self-consciousness, accessibility has become the Getty's watchword as it prepares to greet the world in its splendid new home," says Times art correspondent Suzanne Muchnic."The idea is pretty simple, something all of us arrived at 12 years ago," the Times quotes museum Director John Walsh as saying. "One part of it was to build a museum that put works of art in a really flattering setting. Another part was to give people an opportunity to look at art and then do something else: relax, see the view, sit down, have a cup of coffee. We also believe people enjoy more and remember more about works of art if they are able to learn something about them."The Getty will begin a series of public service announcements and advertising, beginning in August. Schools and community organizations will be invited to visit the new center before the December opening.Information packets are being prepared for churches, schools and neighborhood groups. The new museum will include four information centers, and an activity room devoted to families was shaped with the help of family and child advocates.The Getty expects huge crowds and spent months studying how to deal with potential parking problem.

The art teachers chose some of the best of their students' work."....you wouldn't believe the quality of the work," Tortorici says, according to the Tribune. "I thought we were going to get crayon drawings and finger painting. We have everything from paper figures to 3-D artwork to beautiful paintings. It's amazing what they have done."The network facilitates the interactive dissemination and retrieval of arts and cultural information.

Today, over 2 million people participate in Very Special Arts programs across the country and in 86 countries worldwide.In these pieces Curran has taken a less than 20 second jazz progression and distilled it into several abstracted moments which are introduced and replayed over a period of several minutes.  The jazz source is not heard itself until the very end of "Inner Cities II" and not at all in "Endangered Species."  The most compelling distillation is the extremely elongated one with which both pieces begin, a Feldmanesque upward arpeggio of the melody pitches.  This is repeated with subtle variations in pitch  and rhythm over a considerable period of time.For the listener unaware of the jazz source material, it's not immediately apparent what is going on.  One doesn't know where one is, but somehow it all makes sense. Supove performed the work well, producing a beautiful tone most of the time and a meatier one when the dissonances warranted it.Woolf's "Lament by the Riverside," was a greater pleasure than I already expected.  I'd met Randall seven years ago at June in Buffalo while he was studying at Harvard.  I don't remember the piece of his I heard on the festival but I do recall that I was impressed by the uniqueness of his voice, although I also thought of his music as being a solid part of the Boston academic scene.  In "Lament by the Riverside," his voice has become  much stronger and the influence of academia is apparent only in the solidity of the underlying structure.  For keyboards and narrator (texts attributed to Du Fu and Rich Jandovitz), Supove performs on vintage  electronic keyboards while Woolf recites and manipulates the sounds with  70s era synthesizer modules.  The rhythmic reading and the sensuousness of  the analogue electronics work well with the popular riffs Woolf employs to form the underpinning of the piece.An Appalachian Summer Festival, North Carolina'a premier multi-arts festival, is celebrating its thirteenth season of music dance, theatre, and visual arts, on and around the campus of Appalachian State University in the heart of North Carolina's High Country region.The visual arts play a prominent role in this year's festival, and include the 11th Rosen Outdoor Sculpture Competition & Exhibition, a national juried competition; the Halpert Biennial and a Visual Arts Workshop Series, including a Watercolor, Children's Art and Book Arts Workshops.

"I can not relive my life, nor would I. But in some small way with my God given talents I can chronicle cultures who have a sense of being that knows the scheme of life in a natural order. I do not hope to find peace in this endeavor, for life continues and changes - it is natures way. The old ways are not for these times, but we must tell of them before they pass from memory."Arts-alert-usa reports that on Thursday, calling on his colleagues to: "vote for freedom, vote for the children, vote for the parents, and vote against elite control of Art in America," Representative Dick Armey (R-TX) and Republican colleagues succeeded in a move to end funding for The National Endowment for the Arts and replace federal arts spending with block grants to the states.  The vote was 217 to 216.Arts-alert-usa reports that Moakley also cited 13 not formally reauthorized programs that were offered waivers from the ban on funding programs that haven't been reauthorized. To receive a government appropriation, Congress must vote to authorize the spending as well as appropriate the money. But the NEA has not been formally authorized since 1993. However, Moakley pointed out that only the NEA has been singled for actual defunding out under this provision.Republicans who want to get the government out of the arts funding business and Democrats who want to save the NEA."  The vote was 271 to 155, and it means that there is no money for the NEA in the House appropriations bill.According to Arts-alert-usa, he called the maneuvering "a procedural power play to prevent members of both parties [from exercising the] simple right to vote to continue the NEA as is."  Obey characterized the alternative arts funding scheme as "a sham substitute" and a "phony smokescreen of a substitute amendment" -- stating that it would provide only $500 per school for arts programs.The Post reports that the Democrats, along with many arts advocacy groups, believe that sending the bill to a conference committee with no funding from the House increases the chances that Senate supporters of the NEA will restore the agency's current $99.5 million budget.However, the Times notes that by reducing the NEA subsidy to zero, House opponents of the agency may have enhanced their bargaining position with the Senate so that even if the agency survives, it could face deep cuts."If the NEA is eliminated, the arts will become a private enterprise, the exclusive domain of the wealthy and well connected. The work of the American theater troops, musicians, painters, writers, and photographers belong to every American, not just those who can afford season tickets, private passes, and A-list invitations, " said Representative McGovern of MA, according to Arts-alert-usa.Noting the influence of the NEA on the growth of museums, dance and opera companies, McGovern went on to say, Arts-alert-usa reports, that "Without the NEA, States like Massachusetts will become a tale of two cities. Larger cities like Boston will always find the resources to preserve the cultural centers. It is medium-sized and small cities, it is rural communities like those in my district that will suffer without Federal arts funding."Speaking against the NEA, Representative Ron Packard (R-CA) stated, according to Arts-alert-usa, that "Americans have been inundated with reports of grotesque live performances, blasphemous art exhibits, and obscene publications -- all supported by taxpayer money......Now more than ever, we need to put an end to this inefficient cycle by admitting that the Federal Government has no business funding the arts and eliminate the NEA."David Obey (D-WI) noted that the alternative funding scheme was formulated with neither hearings nor public comment. Arts-alert-usa quotes him as calling the maneuvering "a procedural power play to prevent members of both parties [from exercising the] simple right to vote to continue the NEA as is" and characterizing the alternative arts funding scheme as "a sham substitute" and a "phony smokescreen of a substitute amendment" that would provide only $500 per school for arts programs."The United States often compares itself to other industrialized countries in terms of business creativity and initiative, education and numerous quality-of-life indicators," editorialized THE SEATTLE TIMES.  "European countries, for example, proudly subsidize arts programs.....Art is part of the fabric of life and no one is afraid to emphasize that. .....Killing the NEA is an abdication of an important national responsibility, a move that sends an embarrassing message about the kind of nation this is and designs to be."The poll also found that Two-thirds of all households (66%) may be characterized as player households in which someone plays or has played a musical instrument -- an increase from 62% reported in the 1994 survey.The two-year college was conceived by Wilmington 2000, a group of business leaders whose mission is to revive the city's downtown. The Delaware Division of the Arts reports that on a Thanksgiving trip to Florida about four years ago, Bill Wyer, senior vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware and former head of Wilmington 2000, was inspired by a magazine article he read about an art college in Savannah, Georgia. The school had filled more than a dozen formerly vacant downtown buildings and infused new life into the city. Wyer was instrumental in getting the Corcoran and Pratt to join forces and in finding the location for the new venture.Thus far, Wilmington 2000 has raised close to $5 million to get the project off the ground. Together city and state funds have covered the cost of refurbishing and adapting the building for its new function. The building, which belongs to the Wilmington Economic Development Corporation (WEDCO), a quasi-government agency, will be leased virtually rent-free to the college for the next five years. Donated office furniture and library privileges for students offered by area colleges have helped to contain some of the start-up costs and forged strong community ties.The Delaware Division of the Arts quotes James Lecky, director of the new college as saying, "I wasn't prepared for the level of support and encouragement the local community has shown for this." Creating the new school, he says, is "extremely exciting."The college, Lecky believes, has the major ingredients for success. For one, it is not competing with other local college art programs. Drawing upon the individual strengths of the parent institutions, areas of concentration are: photography, illustration, graphic design and fine arts. An associate degree from Delaware College of Art and Design carries the prestige of The Corcoran and Pratt, but with a significantly lower price tag.

PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS addresses different ways of working with masquerade in the context of a feminist visual art history."Fashion has often been perceived as a form of women's confinement and oppression, but this perspective ignores the richness and complexity of its many cultural and political meanings," the site notes. "Making-up and role-playing are methods of self-expression that can be empowering for the individual artist while also engaging the public domain."Guest curated by Kathryn Walter, Private Investigators takes the form of a series of performance events in the town of Banff and an exhibition of photography, video and multi-media installations in the Walter Phillips Gallery.

The project depicts the controversy and debate surrounding government funding of the arts in this country.The issue has come to a head with House of Representatives' current attempt to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts.

As Americans moved west in the 19th century, the behavior of humans to each other was seldom mitigated by the veneer of polite society. The barroom brawl, the shootout, the holdup, the hanging, the massacre, the hunt, the constant struggle for existence, the taking of territory, were commonplace. In this sometimes comparable new Internet territory in the late 20th century, we do not always behave as we would in our homes or in "meat time" workplaces."I hope we can find a way to get some bipartisan support that will carry over to the House," Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee is quoted as saying in the Chronicle article.Chronicle quotes Senator Slade Gorton, (R-WA) as saying that "There was zero support to kill the National Endowment for the Arts among the members of this subcommittee, and this is a rather conservative subcommittee.

Circuit Riders is a telephone and on-line consulting service that connects arts professionals with qualified consultants who can advise them concerning arts issues for which there is no locally-based assistance.The primary purpose of the program is to address the technical assistance needs of artists and arts organizations primarily based in rural areas in the twelve western states. Circuit Riders services are delivered in the form of telephone or on-line consultations with professionals that range in length from one to four hours in duration. The consultations are available to the client solely for the cost of a long-distance telephone call. The program makes available a number of expert consultants to individuals and organizations that normally would not have access to them.Previous consultation topics, in a variety of artistic disciplines, have included marketing, fundraising, editing and publishing, web site development, management and administration issues, board development, production, and touring.In addition to the revised Circuit Riders program, WESTAF is investigating a number of other methods of assisting individuals and organizations seeking technical assistance.  These methods may include the installation of a 1-900 number offering fee-for-service assistance on a variety of arts related issues and a regular technical assistance column in ARTJOB, WESTAF's bimonthly publication listing employment opportunities in the arts.WESTAF also reports that beginning July 1, ArtJob will once again be operated from within the WESTAF office.  As a result of significant changes that will be made in the operation of ArtJob, subscribers can expect greatly expanded listings beginning this fall."...perhaps the most striking development in England right now is the government's new lottery which earmarks a significant portion of proceeds to the arts.  We were all struck by the sudden influx of funding for capital projects, to be followed by the availability of funding for program support," said Jane Hirshberg, NEFA's Manager of Culture in Community. Hirshberg also noted in NEFA's Newsletter that ".....As a group, we concluded that this may seem like a boon to the arts world at first glance, but could just as easily serve as a destabilizing force which could cause future challenges for artists and arts organizations throughout the United Kingdom.""....in the end, the similarities of the two regions far outweigh the differences," said Bert Crenca, Executive Director, AS220. "I listened to arts administrators complain that individual artists and small organizations were stifled by the feeling of entitlement.  I listened to individual artists complain that regional arts administrators were inhibited by government bureaucracy, and that there was no real support for new and innovative works.Each participant had a different itinerary, making it possible to learn about work in more than twenty towns and cities in the region.  Travelers spent their time meeting with practitioners, seeing work in a variety of art forms, participating in workshops, and generally determining the climate for arts work in the North of England."Like our work in North Bennington, I saw innovative community development and arts models.  These sites are developing and creating long-term, sustainable arts infrastructures and programs which are combined with capital project and neighborhood revitalization initiatives.

I should have been heading home, but I knew no one was there and I didn't want to be in an empty house just yet. I had gone to the Torch, but found only a sign, "Closed from June 29 to July 7." It was a dark and damp night with scattered summer showers. The air was heavy and hard to breath. Out of habit, I reached down and pushed the #3 memory button on my car radio. "Of course", I thought to myself, (only static). "You were there, you saw them shut it down." I could hear the faint sound of another station intruding on the now abandoned frequency. I quickly hit the power switch. I wanted to pound my hands on the steering wheel, but I could not move. I was paralyzed by a sense of emptiness. You know, the kind of emptiness you feel when you have just lost someone or something you really care about and just can't believe it.Devastation, that is the word I had heard over and over again while fielding the countless phone calls we had received over the last few weeks. At that moment I understood what it felt like. The last line of the last song we may ever hear from "our station" kept rolling over and over in my mind; "We can face it together, the way old friends do, we can face it together, the way old friends do."It reminded me of another place where the door was always open. Where people were supportive and always glad to see me. A place where all it took was a phone call to get an invitation to participate. I just walked in unannounced.My friend was home and glad I had stopped in. "What a powerful ending", he said. I was glad he was tuned in. Something about being with someone who had been listening took the edge off the sadness I was feeling. We talked for awhile. I tried to express what the last hour was like.I never did muster up the courage to go home. I woke up on the couch where I had eventually fallen asleep, with the sense of disorientation you have when you wake up and find yourself somewhere away from home. I was expecting, as with most mornings, to arise with a feeling of freshness, sunshine peaking through the windows and the sound of birds singing their morning serenade.But I was depressed, feeling like I hadn't slept in days, a sense of loss still sitting heavy on my chest. I knew I had a long day ahead, and so much to accomplish, but I couldn't shake the devastation I had taken with me into slumber.My friend had already left for work, and I began to feel a sense of urgency to attend to my duties also. On my way back to town, I automatically pressed that #3 memory button on my radio. Static. I turned onto the expressway and accelerated rapidly. Suddenly I couldn't wait to get to the office. I knew people would be calling and stopping by all day. Some would be sharing their stories about where they were "the day the music died."Sen. James Jeffords (R-VT), the Labor and Human Resources Committee chair and the chief sponsor of the reauthorization measure, explained, according to reports from Arts-alert-usa and NASAA, that the bill seeks to strike a balance of support between state and federal leadership in funding the arts.In addition, according to NASAA, the legislation includes a new arts education component, with all funds above $99.494 million available to state arts agencies or other groups to support instruction in the arts.Sources differ as to whether the vote of the full Senate will take place in August or September.

According to the Washington Post, Senator Ted Stevens, the Appropriations Committee chairman, predicts that the Senate bill will face "significant challenges in conference."The study was intended to show positive effects of arts funding and to reframe political debate over government spending. "The idea behind the report is to offer a businessman's approach to this, something that you just could not quarrel with," the New York Times quotes State Arts Council member Reba White Williams as saying."I hope these reports will help both the public and private sector to realize that financial support for the arts is an investment, not a charitable contribution," said Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's cultural affairs commissioner, according to the New York Times.Despite the demonstrated impact of the arts in New York States, arts funding has declined 25 percent since 1990 while at the same time, federal money for the arts in the state fell precipitately and support from private donors decreased. Although, according to the Times, the study did find that in the past two years there has been a mild upward trend in both state and local arts funding in New York.The study concludes, according to the New York Times, that government spending on the arts should be viewed as an investment. It also concludes that spending more money on the arts is a productive way to spend public money -- generating taxes, jobs and economic growth far in excess of the amounts invested.In addition to serving on the board of La Galeria de la Raza and as advisor to the Kearny Street Art Workshop, she is a respected artist whose work is scheduled to be exhibited in the fall at the Oakland Museum, Works Gallery, San Jose State University, and Galeria de la Raza Posada in Sacramento.Prism Gallery in Port Jefferson, MD where he shares the space with interactive sculptor Ed Cornell.

Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) displayed a painting by a high school student and said, according to the Post  "We are not going to give the money to aging hippies anymore to desecrate the crucifix or do other strange things. We are going to give it to our kids, our 10- and 12- and 14-and 16-year-olds who have talent, who want to develop that talent."The emphasis on education coupled with a de-emphasis on funding for individual artist may be sending a double message. "I was pleased and surprised, but I think there was also a level of concern. I know the value of arts in education. But education is more than what happens in the schools," the Post quotes Miriam Flaherty, education director at the Wolf Trap Foundation as saying, Flaherty, who oversees Wolf Trap's Early Learning Through the Arts, points out that directing money to the schools leaves out museums and performing arts centers."I think it sends a mixed message. We will support arts for students, but some of our leaders are saying we don't value it outside of the school setting. That doesn't make sense," the Post quotes her as saying.The Center for Arts Education is a non-profit organization established to administer the $36 million Annenberg Arts and Education Initiative.  Working with the Department of Cultural Affairs, the Board of Education, and the United Federation of Teachers, with support from the Mayor's office and the cultural community, the Center is dedicated to restoring arts education to the NYC public schools."....The range of these partnerships reflects the diversity of arts collaborations in our city," FYI quotes Hollis Headrick, Executive Director of the Center for Arts Education, as saying.  "including model programs and mentoring relationships in which schools that have strong arts-education components help low-performing schools improve student achievement."The Chronicle reports that a 1988 ordinance reclassified industrial and commercial areas to permit residential use for artists and craftspeople whose homes were of "a necessary use to their art production activity." But loft living has become a fashionable residential option that developers are capitalizing on, and the resultant economic realities are forcing out thousands of South of Market residents."From elegant old brick warehouses near the Embarcadero to more modest new structures in lower Potrero Hill and east of the Mission District, loft living is the most popular residential trend in San Francisco," says Chronicle writer Dan Levy.  Levy reports that this year, the Planning Department has received permit requests for 617 new live-work units in the zone, as opposed to the 146 units that were built all last year.The Chronicle reports that many South of Market residents are now calling for stricter enforcement of the live-work requirements, including proof that those moving in to lofts within the zone are actually artists. A complicating factor is the emergence of "Multimedia Gulch" in the area, and the changing definition of what an artist is that the multimedia industry has engendered."The way the law is now, the definition of an artist is very narrow," the Chronicle quotes Planning Director Gerald Green as saying. "We have to consider the high demand for these units."   Green has also said live-work requirements are nearly unenforceable and has raised the possibility that artists "may need to live in different types of housing."CITY LIGHTS YOUTH THEATRE (http://www.clyouththeatre.org) offers children the opportunity to shine.

The ACLU and other cyberadvocates are alarmed by what the ALCU calls "the tenor of the failure to examine the longer-term implications for the Internet of rating and blocking schemes."The ACLU believes that the White House meeting was "clearly the first step away from the principle that protection of the electronic word is analogous to protection of the printed word."  They are concerned that  "Despite the Supreme Court's strong rejection of a broadcast analogy for the Internet, government and industry leaders alike are now inching toward the dangerous and incorrect position that the Internet is like television, and should be rated and censored accordingly."The ACLU suggests that preliminary information about the nature of the speech is preferable.  Preliminary information available on the Internet has several important components that distinguish it from all the ratings systems, they explain.Preliminary information is created and provided by the speaker; it helps the user decide whether to read any further; speakers who choose not to provide such information are not penalized; it does not result in the automatic blocking of speech by an entity other than the speaker or reader before the speech has ever been viewed. "Thus, the very nature of the Internet reveals why more speech is always a better solution than censorship for dealing with speech that someone may find objectionable."The report concludes that "It is not too late for the Internet community to slowly and carefully examine these proposals and to reject those that will transform the Internet from a true marketplace of ideas into just another mainstream, lifeless medium with content no more exciting or diverse than that of television"DETROIT, MI-- A benefit auction is being planned to assist Focus Hope, Inc., in the rebuilding of its facilities and in assisting those who incurred damage due to the July 2nd storm.

"Please - for the sake of us all, but most especially for the sake of our youngsters - do not cut funding to the arts. Make a visit to any number of our schools where the arts are making a vital difference in the lives and well being of our children.  To imagine a community without the energy and vitality of the arts is to imagine one that is truly barren and lifeless."Sotomayor stated, according to the Times that "The plaintiffs' real complaint lies in the fact that modern technology has created a situation in which revision rights are much more valuable than intended at the time that the specific terms of the Copyright Act were being negotiated."  She added that Congress "is of course free to revise that provision to achieve a more equitable result."The World Wide Web, which was not addressed in the suit, has become a major electronic publishing venue since the suit was filed in 1993.

The work in the exhibition reflects the state's places or events, and this month, during the Iowa State Fair, it is featured at the Iowa Tourism Building."Broadening participation in the arts, increasing opportunities for artists, preserving and promoting our cultural resources and investing in communities' quality of life are among the reasons state arts agencies are key players in supporting and leading cultural tourism initiatives,""More important than all of Jerry's professional achievements was his commitment to and love of mentoring others in the field of performing arts presenting and touring.  Hundreds of presenters and artists owe some measure of their professional success to Jerry," the WAAA writes in a press release.In keeping with his principles of peaceful anarchism, the event will include simultaneous performances of different works, as well as related visual and sound events. It is presented as part of the worldwide FREEDOM SUMMER series in conjunction with the Pauline Oliveros Foundation.Describing the premise for the show, the curators write: "The sun bathes our earth with a broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves, but we see only the tiny fraction that we call 'light'. Perception is limited in many ways."The American expatriate composer was best known for his series of studies for player piano, composed and hand-punched on a custom machine, the medium in which he worked almost exclusively for much of the last fifty years,"The NHA states that most of the pressure for a shift to state funding comes from members of Congress and, especially, Congressional staff.  The Federation of State Humanities Councils and the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies have both advised Congress in writing that they support the allocation formulas contained in the Jeffords et al reauthorization bill (S.1020) and that they would not like to see additional resources shifted away from the national programs."The fate of programs, especially grant-making ones, that are block granted is usually they disappear in short order," the NHA's Hammer states. "-- Not the money, which usually continues to flow, but rather it is the programs that disappear."  But, Hammer warns that "The potential for making these changes is good in the Senate where the appropriations bill for FY-98 -- wide open for amendments -- goes to the floor in early September."In addition, NHA points out that the endowments are a tiny portion of the $13 billion Interior Appropriations bill.  The threat of a veto may temper some conferees who have strong interests (with strong constituencies) in the main interior portion of the bill.  Most observers believe that a bill that would end NEA will draw a veto from President Clinton.The arts endowment is much more seriously threatened than NEH at this juncture, according to the NHA.  "It is in the interest of the humanities community that the NEA survive and be rebuilt," they state. "Therefore NHA board continues to recommend that communications to Congress include support for both agencies.""However, in the seventies, when this piece of art was constructed, a 1959 Cadillac was not as hot as it is today. Had the cars not be used for the Ranch, they would most likely have ended up in an obscure junk yard. So, I think they serve a better purpose today by reminding both Americans and foreigners of this great American automotive heritage."The work was designed to be participatory in that visitors are encouraged to add to the graffiti on the cars. "Be sure to take your paint spray cans with you," Lord writes.  "....You can simply write down your name, or if you have an inspiring message, leave it on  one of the cars for the other visitors to read (or to erase).""After that incredible sacred beginning, with a 'Grand Entrance' into the main lobby of the Adam's Mark Hotel," he continues, "we were nearly overwhelmed with an exciting group of twenty two new plays (full-length and one man/woman shows and a backup list of more than twenty five playwrights, waiting to be selected to have their plays read also."Thomson notes that they received nearly one hundred new plays and inquiries from around the country.  "And yes," he faxed to Festival producer/artistic director Larry Leon Hamlin, "there were a few pirated play readings in the hotel conference rooms, when we were not looking and some others booked themselves into outside venues, hotels, clubs and afterhours joints, all around beautiful downtown Winston-Salem.  Yes, 'the genie was out of the Bottle now!' Sorry about that, boss, but folks were going a bit crazy, to get their 'hot new pieces' read by somebody, somethere in town, since they had come all that way, from around the country, coast to coast!

Priority will be given to organizations working in the City and County of San Francisco, though support ext
