At the moment, one company -- NSI -- accounts for well over two-thirds of all gTLD registrar fees and has an effective veto power over the on-going component of the registrar accreditation fee.ICANN's transition budget for FY99-00 (July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000) be allocated among the name and address registries and registrars according to the formula set forth below. In making this recommendation the Task Force accompanies it with the caveat that although it believes these proportional shares are fair and appropriate to the current circumstances of ICANN and the registry/registrar communities, any such formula requires scrutiny over time, and it assumes that this recommendation will be reviewed in connection with development of the ICANN budget for FY00-01, commencing in the spring of 2000. Further, the Task Force notes that due to parallel processes operating with respect to its own work, the negotiations among ICANN, NSI and the USG over pending contract agreements, and the development of ICANN's revised budget projection for the current fiscal year, the percentages used herein are subject to rounding and interpolation as applied to specific agreements to be executed following Board action on the recommendations of the Task Force.The gTLD registrars (and, more importantly, their customers) are the parties that most directly and tangibly benefit from ICANN's pro-competitive policymaking and implementation functions. Much of ICANN's efforts to date have been devoted to developing and implementing a registrar accreditation program, to the ongoing work needed to execute and monitor that program successfully, and to the negotiations required to establish a permanent structure for a competitive registration market in .com, .net, and .org.The gTLD registry will also benefit directly and tangibly from ICANN's pro-competitive policymaking and implementation functions. Under the framework established by Amendment 11 to the Cooperative Agreement between NSI and the U.S. Department of Commerce, the gTLD registry collects a fee from the competitive registrars for every domain name registered in the .com, .net, and .org top level domains.There was discussion among the members of the Task Force as to whether all fees should be collected at the registry level, rather than dividing the funding obligation among the registry and the registrars. At least one member of the Task Force supported the aggregation of funding contributions through the registries only. However the consensus of the Task Force was that a number of practical considerations weigh heavily in favor of a two-tiered funding structure for the total amount attributable to the gTLD registries and registrars. Among these were (1) because a single company continues to serve both as the gTLD registry and as a competitive gTLD registrar, a two-tiered gTLD funding structure best ensured equal treatment among the competing registrars; and (2) a two-tiered gTLD funding structure provides maximum flexibility for the funding structure applicable to future gTLD registries (if any).The Task Force concluded that the share attributable to ccTLD registries should be 35% of the budget. Because of the vast diversity of operational and financial models among the ccTLDs, it was difficult to generalize about their aggregate ability-to-pay.The Task Force concluded that the many differences between domain names and IP addresses warranted differential treatment for the IP address registry contribution. In particular, the Task Force noted that the IP address registries are all member-supported non-profit entities that do not charge per-number fees for IP address allocations. Put another way, the address space is thus not "monetized" in the same manner as the domain name space.The Task Force also discussed the differences between name-to-IP-number resolution, which is carried out by the name registries and is essential to the functionality required by most registrants, and reverse domain name mapping, which is carried out the IP address registries and is not similarly mandatory.D. Distribution of global shares to individual organizations  within classes of ICANN constituents In addition to making recommendations about global aggregate shares, the Task Force discussed a range of issues relating to how those shares should be recovered from individual organizations.The funding responsibilities of registries and registrars must be translated into specific language within the agreements that will be executed among the various parties. This is essential in order to meet the needs for stability and predictability that both ICANN and the registry/registrar organizations require. Accordingly, the Task Force undertook to review some possible models by which distributions could be calculated and reduced to contract language specific to individual entities.The gTLD registrar members of the Task Force reported a broad consensus among gTLD registrars that a volume-based formula was the fairest means to distribute the registrars' global funding share among these businesses, and that the related calculations should be done on a quarterly basis.In addition, the Task Force discussed the need for "floor" and "ceiling" amounts for individual organizations. It believes these are appropriate, but that the specifics of such amounts require further study.The Task Force agreed that the ccTLD registries should determine among themselves the fairest formula for distributing the global ccTLD registry share to individual ccTLD registries. There are a number of models that could be used, including volume-based; banded tiers according to size; and a flat fee per ccTLD registry.Thus, the Task Force is concerned that the ccTLD registries utilize a credible and participatory process from which consensus can reasonably emerge. The Task Force emphasizes that an acceptable result must meet the ccTLD registries' need for fairness and predictability, and ICANN's need for workable contract language.As with the ccTLD registries, the Task Force believes that the IP address registries should determine among themselves a fair division of the global share, using a formula that is appropriate to the individual agreements which the address registries will make with ICANN.Over the course of several meetings, the Task Force discussed the question of the extent to which ICANN's core budget can or should be dependent on sources of income other than contributions from registries and registrars.The Supporting Organizations were made part of the ICANN organization and Bylaws in an effort to ensure that the corporation received the benefit of expert professional technical opinions on policy matters within the scope of ICANN's charter. The SO's are loosely organized, bottom up organizations designed to be inclusive with regard to participation of practicing professionals. This style of organization, and the policy charter, do not lend themselves to the type of organizational structure that could be relied on for significant funding amounts, and the existence of a requirement for such amounts, perhaps in the millions of dollars per SO, would be a substantial, if not fatal, impediment to the accomplishment of the primary policy-making mission of the organizations. The Task Force endorses the Board's current view that while it is entirely appropriate for the SO's to fund their own relatively modest expenses, they should not be regarded as sources of mainstream financial support for ICANN.Some Task Force members questioned why governments were not expected to contribute to ICANN's budget. ICANN staff noted that ICANN's mandate is to accomplish private-sector non-governmental management of its technical coordination and policymaking functions, with private-sector funding.The Task Force recommends that ICANN continue to accept voluntary contributions from legitimate sources, including governments, but that the ICANN budget not become dependent upon governmental contributions.Some Task Force members recommended that ICANN seek to raise funds through membership and meeting fees and sponsorships. ICANN staff welcomed this recommendation and will include further discussion of it in future budget discussions, subject to the restriction imposed by current Board policy that all ICANN events be made accessible to the largest possible audience."ICANN should eliminate the $1 per-year, per-domain name registration user fee. Although the user fee may be determined to be an appropriate method for funding ICANN's activities, it is controversial. We believe a permanent financing method should not be adopted until after the nine elected members are added to the ICANN Board in November. By taking such a step, ICANN will ensure that this important decision is made in accordance with the representative, bottom-up process that is essential for ICANN to carry out its mission. In the meanwhile, we will work with ICANN and the entire Internet community, to the extent permitted by law, to obtain interim resources for ICANN. "A three tier structure is being used in some ccTLD regional bodies and might be adaptable to ICANN's revenue needs. It was agreed that additional work, including modeling of possible numbers and amounts, should be done.It was also pointed out that the IP
