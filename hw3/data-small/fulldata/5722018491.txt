5722018491	These rule changes [to the contract size] are being proposed in order to provide more consistency between the futures and cash markets. Currently the standard cash market transaction requires a delivery rate of 25 MW. Since the delivery rate of many cash market contracts is not divisible by two 2 MW--the delivery rate of the futures contract--it is difficult to use the futures contracts for hedging. A delivery rate of 1 MW would allow traders to more precisely hedge with 25 futures contracts per standard cash market transaction.These changes [to the price limit provisions] help to ensure that futures market prices are able to reflect cash market pricing by not subjecting them to artificial price constraints at times when the market is reacting to fundamental changes in the supply/demand balance. Rule language identical to the language proposed in this submission has already been approved by the Commission for the Exchange's Cinergy, Entergy and PJM contracts.The NYMEX stated in its submission that it plans to make the amendment effective 60 days following notice of Commission approval for application to existing and newly listed months. Exchange staff indicated that the planned implementation date is November 1, 1999.The Division requests comment on the proposed amendments. In addition, the Division requests comment on the Exchange proposal to apply the amendments to certain existing contract months, as noted above.SUMMARY: The Chicago Board of Trade (CBT or Exchange) has proposed amendments to the corn futures contract that would list November and January as additional delivery months. The proposed amendments were submitted under the Commission's 45-day Fast Track procedures which provides that, absent any contrary action by the Commission, the proposed amendments may be deemed approved on September 9, 1999--45 days after the Commission's receipt of the proposals. The Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commission, acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, has determined that publication of the proposals for comment is in the public interest, will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons, and is consistent with the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.The proposed amendments to add November and January trading months will result in a trading month cycle that better reflects the harvest and key marketing periods for corn. Therefore, November and January contracts will increase the harvest and winter marketing hedging effectiveness, respectively. Furthermore, the preservation of the December contract allows a temporary transition period.December, and January contracts to determine which contracts the market prefer. Based on that information and the performance of the new Illinois River delivery system, the Exchange will consider whether further changes in the Corn futures trading months are needed. The December contract is listed through 2001.The proposed amendments will remove the current discount applicable to deliveries at non-mill site warehouses. Thus, rough rice at all regular warehouses would be deliverable at par. The CBT intends to apply the proposed amendments to the September 2000 contract month and all subsequently listed contract months following its receipt of notice of Commission approval.The 15-cent price differential at non-mill site warehouses was specified to reflect a supposed price differential that existed in the cash market between mill site and non-mill site warehouses. The theoretical reason for the price differential was that holders of warehouse receipts at a mill site could have the rice milled by the owner of the mill, a process known as ``toll milling.'' According to several participants in the rice industry, toll milling no longer takes place to any significant extent, and mills will not mill rice that they do not own. On June 9, 1999, a consensus was reached by a rice industry group assembled by the Chicago Board of Trade that toll milling indeed no longer takes place. The group also agreed that because toll milling no longer takes place, no differential exists in the cash-market price between rice at mill sites and non- mill sites. Therefore, the 15-cent per hundredweight discount for delivery at non-mill site warehouses is no longer appropriate.The Commission requests that commenters address the extent to which the proposed amendment would reflect the relative value of rough rice stored at mill site warehouses versus rough rice stored at non-mill site warehouses and the potential effects of the proposed amendment on the supply of rough rice likely to be economically available for delivery on the contract as well.Fast Track procedures which provide that, absent any contrary action by the Commission, the proposed amendments may be deemed approved on September 13, 1999--45 days after the Commission's receipt of the proposals. The Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commission, acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, has determined that publication of the proposals for comment is in the public interest, will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons, and is consistent with the purpose of the Commodity Exchange Act.The Commission particularly requests that commenters address the extent to which a zero price differential between Minneapolis/St. Paul and Chicago (that is, par delivery for both points) falls within the range of normal commercial price differences between these locations, and the extent to which the proposed amendments will affect economically deliverable supplies for the oats futures contract.The Concept Release sought public comment on computational and disclosure matters relating to participation in programs of commodity trading advisors (``CTAs'') on a partially-funded basis and raised specific questions regarding a number of issues: (1) Improving risk profile data for clients considering participation in CTA programs on a partially-funded basis; (2) providing CTA client account information to futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') to aid the FCM's risk management; (3) improving risk profile data on commodity pools; (4) providing a theoretically sound basis of computation and presentation for rate of return (``ROR'') and related risk profile data; (5) improving the presentation of historical performance and risk profile data; and (6) providing periodic statements of program activity and results to CTA clients.In response to the questions raised in the Concept Release, some commenters indicated concern regarding the validity of the nominal account size and the ability of clients to interpret and compare performance data presented on a basis other than the actual funds deposited in a client's account. However, the majority of commenters, including NFA, the Managed Funds Association (``MFA''), and several CPOs and CTAs, expressed support for the use of nominal account size as the basis for computing ROR and presenting the CTA's past performance.The Concept Release also discussed the current requirements for disclosure of draw-down information pursuant to Rules 4.35(a)(1)(v) and (vi), and asked for comment on the possibility of expanding draw-down disclosure in two areas. First, the Concept Release sought comment on the advisability of requiring draw-down percentage data to be presented at two or three partial-funding levels that are representative of those offered by the CTA, in addition to the fully-funded level. Second, the Concept Release sought comment on the concept of enhancing disclosure of a program's historical volatility, possibly by expanding the time period for historical performance disclosure; reducing the amount of monthly data; and requiring more detailed information concerning the volatility of the CTA's program, either through an expanded number of worst draw-down months, or by requiring presentation of the standard deviation of the monthly returns.A number of commenters expressed concern that requiring too many items of data would result in less attention being paid to that information. The Commission has been attentive to those concerns. In seeking to highlight the increased leverage--and consequent increased risk--in partially funding accounts, the Commission has proposed a set of disclosures that is significantly limited compared to that discussed in the Concept Release.A number of other ideas discussed in the Concept Release generated substantial opposition from commenters. These include a requirement that a CTA provide a copy of its agreement with the client to the client's FCM and additional reporting requirements for CTAs. The Commission has determined not to include these in the proposed rules.The Commission has carefully considered the comments received, and has determined to revise its rules to provide a comprehensive framework for addressing certain of the issues raised in the Concept Release. In making the current proposal, which incorporates most of the concepts included in the NFA proposal, the Commission seeks to simplify the recordkeeping and computational requirements for CTAs who accept partially-funded client accounts, while providing for meaningful and focused disclosure to clients regarding the past performance of the CTA, and the risks attendant upon trading on a partially-funded basis.In particular, the Commission has determined to revise its rules to require that ROR be computed by dividing net performance by the nominal account size. This change is intended to reduce regulatory burdens by relieving CTAs of the responsibility for tying nominal account size to actual funding levels, and to permit a uniform method for CTAs to calculate their RORs, regardless of whether they accept partially- funded client accounts. As discussed below, CTAs who wish to measure performance on an actual funds basis may do so by setting the no
