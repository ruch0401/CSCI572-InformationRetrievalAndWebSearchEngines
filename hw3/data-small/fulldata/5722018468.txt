Specifically, whereas the United States once borrowed only occasionally, in order to finance emergencies or its own expansion-i.e., to fund wars, pull itself out of economic depression, or invest in its own infrastructure[12]-in the last several decades it has been borrowing on a consistent annual basis simply to pay the overall cost of programs authorized by Congress and the President. Thus, the last thirty years have seen sustained growth not only in the size of the national debt, but in its proportion relative to the Gross National Product (GNP) and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).[13] As the proportion of debt to GNP/GDP has increased, *** Top of Page 138 *** so too has the "debt servicing burden"-i.e., the percentage of the GDP and government revenue spent servicing the national debt.[14] If this trend continues, the American people will be forced to give up more and more of their income in order to pay interest to their (in many cases overseas)[15] creditors, which in turn will lead to a persistent decline in the dollar's international value and, therefore, purchasing power.[16] Indeed, no less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern about future debt-to-GDP ratios and a consequent decline in living standards if national borrowing continues on its current path.[17] The debt limit statute plays a vital role in this context because although its existence has not stopped the trend towards increased borrowing, it has slowed that trend by acting as a catalyst for budget-reform and budget-balance measures aimed at reducing national borrowing.In order to appreciate the enduring need for the debt limit statute, it is necessary first to understand the evolution of Congress's borrowing and debt repayment practices-i.e., the evolution of our national debt. Part I of this Article briefly explores the nation's history of debt incurrence and repayment, including adoption of the debt limit statute in 1917 and subsequent modifications to its operation. Part II elucidates the constitutional and institutional role played by the debt limit statute in the deliberative process concerning national borrowing and debt. Part III discusses criticisms leveled at the debt limit and demonstrates that they both exaggerate actual experiences under the debt limit statute and fail to appreciate the statute's beneficial effects.Since the inception of the United States in 1789, Congress has given the Secretary of the Treasury substantial authority over monetary policy, including the issuance and repayment of debt instruments.[20] But while Congress initially maintained significant control over the conditions under which national debt could be incurred, over time it increasingly has *** Top of Page 140 *** delegated even this authority to the Treasury Secretary.[21] Further, although Congress and the Executive followed a careful fiscal policy of balanced budgets and peacetime debt repayment for the first 150-odd years of the nation's history, they have allowed serial deficits and continuing debt expansion for the last sixty-plus years. The historical evolution of the United States' debt can be broken down into roughly three periods: 1789-1917, when debt was incurred exclusively to pay for wars and to sustain the economy during a recession, but paid down immediately upon return to peace and prosperity; 1917-1946, when Congress passed the debt limit statute granting the Treasury standing borrowing authority, but continued to manage debt incurrence and repayment in substantially the same manner as before; and 1946 to the present, when changed attitudes towards debt and the debt limit have produced sustained peacetime deficits and virtually no debt reduction.Section A of this Part describes Congress's approach to debt issuance and payment prior to 1917. Section B examines the Second Liberty Bond Act (the debt limit statute) and the manner in which it delegates some of Congress's control over borrowing to the Treasury Secretary. Section C explores the shift in how Congress and the nation have used debt since the 1960s as well as the changing role of the debt limit statute in fiscal policymaking over the past forty years.As the following historical analysis reveals, the details and philosophy of congressional management of the national debt have changed dramatically in the course of our nation's history. But significantly, even as our national economy, debt incurrence, and repayment practices have developed, the debt limit statute has given Congress a forum for periodic assessment, criticism, and reform of national borrowing policy, and has forced Congress and the President to be publicly accountable for their borrowing decisions.Thus, from 1789 to 1917, Congress's approach to debt was conservative. Although the government was unafraid to incur debt, it preferred to meet its expenses with tariff and tax revenue, and borrowed only when faced with the exigent circumstances of war or economic recession. Moreover, once these exigencies abated, Congress immediately began to pay down and reduce the debt it had incurred.Thus, although the original debt limit statute granted the Treasury Secretary standing authority to borrow and eliminated congressional control over some of the more minute details of debt issuance, Congress continued to maintain a heavy hand in supervising the particulars of national borrowing under this first iteration of the statute.Despite this unprecedented string of deficits, congressional action under the debt limit statute from World War I through World War II remained substantially similar to its previous approach to national borrowing. Although the absolute amount and duration of debt incurrence during this period was staggering, such borrowing remained consistent with the old consensus that debt could and should be incurred in times of war and economic depression. In fact, the only deviation from prior norms was the government's creation of new program spending in the midst of the depression (although it was not new for outlays to increase during a depression, such increases never before had been so steady and sharp,[85] nor had they been the result of deliberate government expansion of program spending).Thus, whereas Congress in the 1960s came to view legislation increasing the statutory debt limit as inevitable, in the 1970s it came to view such legislation as a painful, if necessary, evil from which political cover was required.Bush's efforts to fund a massive war on terror without raising taxes-and while in fact cutting taxes[145]-portend exponential expansion of the national debt, particularly when viewed against the national history and precedent of paying for major wars with a combination of tax increases and federal borrowing, rather than federal borrowing alone.While such criticism is not entirely without merit, it derives from a superficial understanding of the statute's operation. Upon careful evaluation, it is clear that the statute retains enduring value. First, the statute plays a constitutionally necessary role in effecting congressional control and accountability over borrowing and the national debt.I, Section 8, Clauses 1 ("to pay the Debts") and 2 ("to borrow Money on the credit of the United States").[148] On its face, the first imposes a fiscal obligation on Congress while the second confers broad fiscal authority. But as with many provisions in our Constitution of limited federal powers, this is not all that the clauses dictate or demand. Inherent in the clauses' language is a sense of balance, of congressional control and accountability for national borrowing and the debt it creates. From these clauses, we can derive three principles of congressional borrowing and debt payment.First, a Principle of Regulated Borrowing: Congress has the power to regulate the terms and conditions under which the nation borrows funds. The power to borrow money encompasses power to regulate the terms on which the money will be borrowed-e.g., to fix interest rates, loan format, maturity dates, and to decide from whom the government shall borrow. Indeed, during the early years of our nation's history, it was established that Congress's power to borrow included the incidental power to incorporate a national bank from whom it would borrow, thereby creating conditions under which national borrowing could take place safely and efficiently.[149] The Principle of Regulated Borrowing also entails congressional control over the terms on which the government repays its debt.Second, a Principle of Borrowing and Debt Control: It is Congress's prerogative and duty to decide how much the nation will borrow and for what purposes. The power to borrow money would be merely administrative if it did not entail control over the amount and basis for borrowing. Thus, inherent in the power to borrow is an obligation, as the branch most closely connected to the populous, to exercise judgment in deciding when and under what circumstances to commit the nation and the public to indebtedness.In addition, the structure of Article I, Section 8 implies that Congress is to be accountable to the people regarding its decisions about national borrowing and repayment of the debt with which it saddles the nation. The first clause of Article I, Section 8 confers both the power to tax and the power to pay debts; the power to borrow is conferred immediately thereafter, in the section's second clause. This structure is no accident.The three powers are listed together because they are interrelated. As noted above, the founding fathers created the power to
