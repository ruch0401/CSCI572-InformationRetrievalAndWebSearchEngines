In high school, he was selected to play in the 104-member McDonald's All-American Band. When he was offered a four-year Regent's Scholarship at Arizona State University to study under one of the best euphonium teachers in the country, the decision was easy.Following graduation, Asbill accepted a job at Laing Middle School in Mount Pleasant, S.C. He built up the program until the band was invited to perform at the Mid-West International Band and Orchestra Clinic, becoming the first middle school band from the State of South Carolina to do so in 52 years. A month later, he was invited to teach at Wando High School in Mount Pleasant.Four years later, the University of Michigan offered a fellowship to enroll in its conducting program. Again, the decision was simple. "It was a chance of a lifetime," Asbill says. "Not only is the program one of the best in the country, but the high level of the artistic community at the University of Michigan is unparalleled."After earning his master's degree last spring, Asbill saw a great opportunity to build a strong program at the University of New Mexico. As associate director of bands, he directs the Symphonic Band, the Spirit Marching Band and Sound Pack, the small band that plays at Lobo basketball games. "I'd like to see the marching band grow to 200 members and achieve a higher level of performance," he says. "I also want to assist the music education majors here at the University of New Mexico in their goals of becoming both fine musicians and educators."Growing up outside New York City, Henry Bial, assistant professor of theater, spent many hours in the cheap seats of Broadway theaters, developing a love that has never left him. Although I has dabbled in all aspects of theater, from acting to lighting design, he discovered a talent for teaching after graduating from Harvard University with a degree in folklore and mythology.He returned to New York and earned a master’s degree and doctorate in performance studies at New York University. While there, he co-edited, with NYU Professor Carol Martin, Brecht Sourcebook, a collection of writings by and about German playwright and director Bertholt Brecht. He currently is working on a book based on his dissertation, entitled, Acting Jewish on the American Stage and Screen, a look at how "Jewishness" is communicated in mainstream American entertainment.At UNM, he teaches theater appreciation, theater history, theories of the theater and performance theory. In addition to scholarship, Bial, who has provided lilting lighting design for several off-off Broadway plays, continues to engage in the hands-on aspects of theater. "If I go four-to-five months without standing on a ladder, my scholarship gets stale," he says.But Bial's favorite stage is the classroom where he gets to play himselfhis best role. “I like the person-to-person connection and working with a group of people to help get them from one place to another," he says. "And this doesn't give me stomach pains and make my hair fall out like acting does."When Kirsten Buick enrolled in the University of Chicago, she took the advice of her parents and set about to acquire a skill. She decided to learn Italian. Once she mastered that, she began taking Italian literature courses (taught in Italian), combining her new skill with a lifelong enjoyment of reading. "Through literature I discovered art," she says.By the time she entered graduate school at the University of Michigan, Buick was committed to a career as-an art historian. During a six-month visit to Italy in graduate school, she began to ponder the pervasiveness of American culture overseas, by the time she returned home, she had decided to combine her three interests: Italian, the 19th century and art of the U.S. Her dissertation focuses on Mary Edmonia Lewis, an American artist who lived in Italy in the 19th century.As she competed her dissertation, Buick worked full time as a museum educator at the Art Instate of Chicago, where she sharpened her teaching skills. Buick also discovered the benefits of presenting one slide at a time instead o f the traditional two slides. "I noticed that students can concentrate better and retain the artwork's significance," she says.At the College of Fine Arts, where she is an assistant professor teaching American art, she enjoys the collegiality of the faculty and the dedication of her students. "They do all the reading and even talk in class," she says.She looks forward to encouraging her students to look beyond conventional methods and approaches to studying art. In her own work, most recently, she has written a paper about the depletion of race in New England colonial portraits. And during the spring 2002 semester, she plans to offer a class on "unnatural history," which will explore the pathological body in the 19th and 20th centuries.Like many successful actors, Eugene Douglas got his start in elementary school. By junior high and high school in his hometown of Lawton, Okla., he was landing lead roles. Although he tried to branch out into film directing during college at the University of Oklahoma, he always returned to performing. "I always ended up acting in my films," he says.By the time he was in graduate school at the University of California at Irvine, Douglas had turned his attention to teaching. Contrary to many of his classmates who were teaching so they could afford to pursue acting, "I had to act to pay for my teaching," he remembers. He lobbied his professors for teaching assignments, eager to learn the fine art of teaching actors. "I love to see the interaction and the follow-through on an idea." Douglas was one of UC-Irvine’s first graduates asked to teach there after earning his master's degree. He also taught classes at a children's theater in southern California.Before joining the UNM faculty as an assistant professor, Douglas knew Albuquerque as the perfect overnight stop on the trip home to Oklahoma. Now it is home. He enjoys learning from senior faculty and collaborating with his colleagues in the Theatre and Dance Department to continually fine-tune their teaching methods to stay competitive, lively and innovative.Douglas is completing The Actor's Checklist, a book to help acting students of all levels gain clarity with their craft. He also plans to write plays, which would debut at UNM, and, of course, to perform.Kimberly Fredenburgh was a student at State University of New York at Stonybrook when some friends suggested she see a different part of the country. A native of Poughkeepsie, she had never lived anywhere but the Northeast.She decided to spend a semester at the University of New Mexico and ended up staying two years, graduating with a bachelor of university studies degree, with a science emphasis. While at UNM, she also studied music and played in the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra, Santa Fe Symphony and the Chamber Orchestra of Albuquerque.Despite her science concentration in college, Fredenburgh knew her orchestra experience deemed her a professional musician, and she was more interested in pursuing a career in music. Her first job was as associate principal violist with the Shreveport Symphony Orchestra in Louisiana, followed by a position with the New World Symphony in Miami, where she was co-principal violist.After two years, she became the youngest person in the Phoenix Symphony Orchestra, where she also was associate principal violist. During her six years in Phoenix, she earned a master's degree in string pedagogy from Arizona State University and subsequently joined the faculty there.During the summer off-season, she played for the Santa Fe Opera, where she met her husband, Kevin Vigneau, an associate professor of oboe at UNM. They decided to live in Albuquerque, where she won the position of assistant principal with the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra.Joining the UNM faculty as associate professor, she returns to a role she first played when she was 12 years old--that of teacher. The daughter of a violinist and violin teacher, Fredenburgh prepared beginning students for her mother's more advanced instruction. "By the time I was 15, I had 20 students," she says."I like working with people who come to me with very different musical backgrounds and getting them to play to the best of their abilities," she says. "The reward is sitting in Keller Hall and hearing what they have accomplished and knowing that I helped them accomplish it."Fredenburgh, a horse lover, also taught riding lessons in the summers during high school and college. Now she and her husband live on a horse farm in the South Valley, where they breed horses and train them in dressage.As a Girl Scout, Jocelyn Nevel learned how to make photograms--camera-less photographs. Her subject matter was mostly transparent rulers, coins, torn newspaper and children's scissors. By the time she entered Ohio State University in her hometown of Columbus, Ohio, Nevel was planning to pursue a profession as a commercial photographer. "Despite my best intentions to be a certain kind of photographer, I kept printing my images on shirts and aprons," she says. "It was a big step when I started to leave photographs out of my work."In some ways, she returned to the photograms of her youth. "I'm fascinated with the performative aspect of making them, how different objects and tones appear,” she says.  As she moved through graduate school at Columbia College Chicago, Nevel began to explore the detritus of urban life.  Her work has involved a grid-like photogram display of lint from clothes dryers and another made of used tea bags. Last year, she crocheted sausage casings into dainty doilies. "I like to create a paradox of something beautiful and repulsive at the same time," she says. "The banal minutiae of daily life is fascinatin
