The firm assesses a client's risks, its state of current security, and then recommends specific strategic, practical and integrated security solutions. With a thirty-year history of reliable service, and operating from offices in 60 cities around the world, the firm provides services and solutions to a broad range of companies, organizations, and entities -- from college campuses to the Los Angeles Police Department.One of the most valuable FileMaker Pro applications stands at the center of one of the most essential components of Kroll's work: the Physical Security Service assessment -- the first step in the firm's examination of a client's security profile. "We take stock of their physical issues and security and crisis management policies, and then develop a gap analysis which outlines the situation as it currently exists -- and what it should be," Jeff explains. "Everything from photos of facilities to specifics of findings are considered in preparing this analysis."Before Jeff -- before FileMaker Pro -- this process was done by entirely manual methods, involving a great deal of paper-shuffling and data entry work. Reports then had to be generated for the client from this mass of data. Now, however, the process is much quicker and much more efficient, thanks to FileMaker Pro's data-management power. "All the components of the report go into relational FileMaker Pro databases that detail what we were looking for, what we found, and what we recommend," Jeff details. "From these databases we're able to easily generate a comprehensive report for the client. The amount of time it took to generate these reports manually varied from client to client -- but I can tell you there's been a dramatic improvements since the implementation of FileMaker Pro, both in terms of the work process and the look and feel of the reports themselves."Now, Kroll maintains about thirty FileMaker Pro databases, with up to four workgroups accessing them at any given time. And Jeff is always looking for new ideas, new techniques for putting FileMaker Pro's power to work.
