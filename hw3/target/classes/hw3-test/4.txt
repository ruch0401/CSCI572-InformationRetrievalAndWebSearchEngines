5722018496	"It is an area with many `relics' from before The War,"  she spoke, her midnight dark eyes meeting mine.  Tasha was an attrac- tive  woman, intelligent, a surviving member of a race  that  was almost  extinct here in North America.  Luckily for us  Carl  had brought her with him on this voyage, perhaps feeling that her in- timate knowledge of the area we were going to might be of help in our perhaps hopeless attempt to wipe out the pirates that infest- ed these islands and coves hundreds of miles north of Dularn.   I supposed  too that there were the usual reasons for having  one's wife aboard.  Many naval captains of this era do such things  now if there are no children involved that require a parent's care...Tasha was Carl's second wife, the first having died in the bitter warfare there between California and Dularn back in 2565.   There had been a son, now old enough to take care of himself.  I didn't think he cared too much for Darlanis, or "what" she represented."I have a question for you, Admiral," Tasha said to me, Dar- lanis having just left for the Sarnian Queen, the African woman's eyes dark pools that glowed up into mine.  She was quite "differ- ent" from the Blacks of the 20th Century, although I suppose that was  a matter of "culture", not "race" as such.  In any case  she considered  herself a "Dularnian" as much as I did.   Her  birth- place  had been in Trelandar, she had been a friend of Sanda  Ta- len, and after Trelandar had been conquored by Darlanis Tasha had found it "wise" to leave the country, having ended up in Dularn. It is "said" that the ruins of Los Angeles are inhabited by them, the Queen of Trelandar stating that she has seen some  sort of "creatures" that walk on two legs living in the ruins of  that once great city when she flew over the ruins in her airplane.  Richard Handler said "it was just a natural" to add material about Islamic cultures this spring in his introductory anthropology class at the University of Virginia, where the primary task is "understanding human diversity.""Even if you are only interested in a military response or a response grounded in power politics, you would want to know who you are dealing with," Handler said. War when the surviving rural population took matters in their own hands.  I think work is transformed into something different from itself when it is paid for.Circa: late 1995.  I could see how much easier joining image and text would be -- something I was already doing in the small press world.  "Red Mona" was my first piece online. Bradley Spatz, a computer science engineer, developed a random script for that project.I was a mature artist by the time I arrived.   In  any case it appears now that Black  women  were  the first  "slave  girls", with white women soon afterwards  in  turn suffering the exact same fate in the almost constant struggle for survival that was "life" on an radioactive and freezing planet."What  do we have?" I asked, climbing up the  metal  ladder, captain Sandra Steven now peering through a telescope at the dis- tant mast heads of the North Star there on the horizon.  Technical research included library research, the conducting of key informant interviews, and other means of information retrieval required in the writing-up of detailed technical reports for our coalition partners. The mid- shipman  beside her, the smoke rising up from our  triple  stacks amidships,  the other ships following in a line there behind  us.The North Star was acting as a scout, being quite a bit  "faster" than  the  square rigged Imperial steam frigates  in  sailing  to windward.   A cool sea breeze blowing off the Pacific as I  stood there with them now on the top of the forward quickfirer turret.I could see the two ships as the Diana came chugging up, the three  Imperial steam frigates now holding their  position  close by,  while the Northlight kept its station on us astern.   I  did not  "envy" the captain or crew of the captured  raiding  vessel, especially as Darlanis is not too "patient" a woman and I expect- ed that she wouldn't be too "gentle" with her captive either now."If  we destroy these pirate bases and their ships,  then  I think your Queen will grant me the `assistance' I desire," Darla- nis answered, her azure eyes holding mine.  I thought of the  in- nocents that would be killed, the women and children as our ships fired broadsides of javelins and fire bombs into defenseless vil- lages.  I remembered another war, another time now mostly "myth"."I think we could `hire' these people to fight for `us',"  I said, keeping my voice level, ignoring the Empress' own  "insult" which  really didn't mean all that "much" to me, not as it  might to someone actually "from" this time, who would see it different.And  Dularn could use "allies" here, especially as Queen  Valeris was  starting to "worry" us now with her own "activities",  there having been a minor clash between her forces and the Wyomings.  I was  well  aware of the "dangers" of "feminism",  especially  the "sort" that Queen Valeris represented, in an "era" like this one.Sandra nodding as I stepped down into the boat, the village there on  shore much like that the Vikings had built sixteen  centuries before.   With me was the lieutenant from the raider, the  vessel having  escorted us into this little snug bay.  While  the  Diana was  in no danger due to its construction, any wooden ship  would have been in a lot of trouble, judging from the catapults set up.Dularn  as she had seemed.  That she still lusted after the  "em- pire" of her dreams, a "second Rome" here on the western coast of North America stretching from Baja to Alaska.  A social order  of semi-independent nations all ruled by that tall Imperial Empress."It  is a steam powered battleship, proof against all,  your majesty,"  I answered, seeing her nod.  Her name was  Freydis,  a fitting name I felt for such a woman.  With Dularnian weapons and our own "advisors" she might be able to hold Valeris at bay  now."You  wish to cross blades with me?" I smiled back,  undoing my ornate uniform coat, handing it to the awed midshipman  stand- ing  behind  me.  A lot of the women of this time  have  inflated opinions  of their own abilities.  There are, so far as  I  know, only  three  that are better than me, and I'm married to  one  of them.  One of the other two was aboard the Diana waiting for us.It is similar in a way to knife fighting techniques as taught  by my old D.I. when I was a new recruit in the U.S. Marines back  in the  20th Century.  The long heavy sword as used by those to  the north of Dularn is not really as "effective" a weapon as thought."Queen Freydis Thorson," Freydis answered, stepping up on to the  metal surfaced inside deck of the Diana, regarding  Darlanis with  that "look" that one warrior woman gives another  if  she's not  at all sure that she's too "friendly".  Freydis was also  of course well aware that Darlanis was the "source" of her problems.Darlanis is a very "popular" monarch, even although "life"  under her rule is not as "free" as one might wish it to be, mainly  due to the fact that Darlanis herself has a hard time "understanding" these  sort of things.  A problem "compounded" by the  fact  that Queen Sharon herself is a "liberal" in the late 20th Century way.Trelandar  than in the rest of the Empire in the sense  of  there being less "restriction" of business and so forth.  Sarn and  Ta- lon  (Queen Dai is quite "liberal") are thus in a way quite  like the United States of the last decade of the Twentieth Century.  I suspect too that Darlanis' own political viewpoint is colored  by the fact that she considers herself to be following in the "foot- steps"  of Janet Rogers, who is of course now almost  "worshiped" by many people still despite the fact that she was more a benevo- lent dictator than any actual "champion of freedom" as such...I was strongly tempted just then to point out that the only "dif- ference" between her and Princess Tara was the fact that she  was "blonde"  and Tara "brunette".  Darlanis is an  extremely  "ambi- tious"  woman, one who believes she was destined to  rule  "all"."You have a `choice'," Darlanis snapped to Freydis, standing up, the rapid rise and fall of her breast leaving no doubts as to the emotions she felt burning through her body.  "You can  either decide  to support me or watch your country be destroyed,  turned into a lifeless wasteland as a memorial to your own stupidity.""You  sent the other ships away," Queen Freydis said to  me, her steel gray eyes burning into mine as we sat there at the long oak  table, a number of rough looking men sitting there with  us, such being Freydis' own advisors and military commanders.  A num- ber of slave girls, some of who I suspected were "Dularnian", be- ing of "service" to us.  The smoke from the cooking fires and the very  "attire" of these people reminding me again of the  Vikings of perhaps the Tenth or Eleventh Century.  Their "culture"  being quite  similar except that they built a better grade  of  raiding ship,  their fore and aft rigged schooners the equal of  anything that had ever come out of a shipyard back home there in Arsana.Neither the North Star or the Northlight were a match for  Darla- nis' steam frigates, and the Diana could easily "handle" anything that the Imperials possessed.  I had a great deal of "confidence" in my "invincible battleship", which no weapon of this era  could even "dent", the Diana being for all practical purposes invulner- able to all known weapons with the possible exception of cannons.Queen  Freydis as boatload after boatload of firewood  was  taken out  to the Diana.  I would stuff the ship full, stack it  every- where  I could.  I needed the "range" to be able to fight  effec- tively against roving Imperial ships that I'd find to the north."My sex will," Freydis smiled.  I knew that Dularnian  slav- ers used to pick off "Northmen girls" whenever they could get the chance to do so.  Such women were considered to be ideal servants back in Dularn, although the Imperial female slave is  considered "better"  at pleasing a master.  "It is wrong to enslave  us  be- cause of our sex," she added, reminding me muchly of Maris Marn."`Enemy in sight'," the midshipman called down, the scouting fourth rate turning away, fleeing back to our protection.  I  had little  doubt  that Darlanis would fight.  She  had  three  steam frigates, three first rate triremes, all "54's", an equal  number of  lesser smaller biremes, perhaps a couple "third  rates"  (two masted  fore and aft schooners), along with armed transports  and everything else.  The "fact" that the Imperials were "willing" to divide  their forces such spoke much of what  Darlanis'  ultimate intentions here were.  With "hostile" power to the north, to  the south, Darlanis had no doubt hoped to "persuade" Queen Maris that the best "option" she had here was to "submit" to Imperial  rule."Darlanis is now letting her triremes take the lead," Sandra said  to me, peering through the still open hatches as the  Diana approached the enemy fleet at three quarters speed.  I thought of Darlanis,  tall and golden.  I respected the woman,  admired  her even if she was an enemy of the ideals for which Dularn stood.  I had to admit that Darlanis was meeting me as best she could,  her triremes being the only vessels with any hope of matching the Di- ana  in battle.  Their iron shod rams the only weapon that  could possibly now pierce the battleship's armored hull, two inches  of steel behind six inches of oak there below the water line."Close  all hatches, watertight doors, go to full power,"  I replied, Sandra pushing the "repeaters" to full ahead now,  Queen Freydis  standing there at my side, while a midshipman made  her- self "useful" by closing the control cabin's heavy steel hatches."Those galleys will be slower than us, but handier,"  Sandra commented, obviously thinking out herself what "attacks" that  we might make here.  They were coming for us under oars only, like a trio  of great centipedes creeping across the calm ocean  towards us.   The sun bright in the sky overhead, a few  clouds  breaking the  monotony of the azure blue.  The Diana leaping forward  with every "thud" of her engines, like a charger heading for battle..."We will have to `flank' them," I said, well aware that Dar- lanis was fully prepared to "sacrifice" her entire naval force if only she could destroy the Diana.  The Empress well aware that as long as the Diana sailed the seas that her ambitions could  never be.  Lorraine's own battleship having struck an "uncharted"  rock and  sunk  on  its own maiden voyage only a  short  time  before.A "weapon" built by a man of the Twentieth Century against  those of a more "primitive" era.  Far behind us now the three ships  of Queen  Freydis were swinging out, moving to circle in, to  strike at  Darlanis' relatively "unprotected" rear.  I thought of  Maris Marn, of Carol, of a Queen standing there beside me, her trust in this  strange  "machine" she hardly understood.  I  felt  Freydis place her hand on my shoulder.  Her steel gray eyes meeting mine.Diana coming around, the "thudding" of the triple engines  hardly noticed.   The Diana now racing towards the west, the three  gal- leys  turning in pursuit, too slow by far to match  our  superior speed  as I circled them.  I now spun the wheel in the other  di- rection, the Diana coming about again, the galleys trying to fol- low us about, their own missiles harmlessly striking against  the Diana's armored hull, although the catapult shots were "noisy"..."An  `obsolete  technology'," I said, the Diana  facing  off against one of the remaining galleys, the other apparently  being too  badly  damaged from its collision to  continue  on  fighting right now.  A more "competent" commander than Darlanis might have used  better tactics, but Lorraine was thousands of miles to  the south, fighting a "holding action" against the Mexican Empire..."Mankind,  and now `Womankind' too," I said, looking at  the three  women there gathered around the table, the  stern  cabin's open  hatches bringing in what breeze there was here in the  bay, "Has  yet to learn that there are better ways of resolving  `dis- putes' than recourse to the sword.  And that building better  and better weapons such as this ship in the long run gains nothing."Valeris  said, her attire even more "barbaric" than  Queen  Frey- dis', while Darlanis in her golden mesh added her own  glittering beauty to the setting.  "And unless this can sail across the land as  well as it can on water I don't think you could stop me  from freeing women from `masculine oppression' wherever I wish to go.""I had a `dream' one time long ago, of a `united world',  of a  `world' without war, without slavery, without all the  `evils' we  have now," the Empress said, standing there, looking out  one of the hatches at the still calm waters of the bay.  "The `world' that Janet Rogers gave to Mankind for a brief few decades  before the Lorr destroyed everything."  I knew Darlanis "worshiped"  Ja- net  Rogers,  having once even seen Lorraine as  something  of  a "second Janet Rogers", the term so "common" in this time that  it is often used in referring to any who seek high political office."I  am  `aware' of that fact," I answered.  At  the  present time it was possible in theory at least that I could wipe out the Imperial Navy, although just what "good" that would do Dularn was another question.  My position, or rather Dularn's here was  much the  "same" as the United States faced just after World War  Two, the Diana being the "atomic bomb" of this era in a certain sense."Do we have enough fuel to reach Dularn?" I asked Daris that evening, such concerns always on my mind, given the way that  the Diana  burned fuel in her boilers.  Darlanis would follow  us  to Dularn, and hopefully she and Maris could work something out now."Inform the crew we will sail at dawn," I said, Sandra  nod- ding.  Some of Queen Valeris' women hadn't been so "hostile"  to- wards  men after all, our men had found.  And there were  also  a fair  number of Imperial Warrioresses who weren't all  that  "un- friendly" after having a "tour" of the Diana.  We had, of  course wisely kept the engine and boiler rooms guarded just to be safe."I  think maybe I'll get married again," Sandra said to  me, the  sea  breeze  coming through the open  control  room  hatches bringing with it the familiar smell of the sea.  There was a  bit of "weather", not enough to really "bother" things, but the Diana was throwing up a bit of spray, enough from time to time to get a few droplets in through the forward hatches.  Behind us came  one of Darlanis' steam frigates, the rest of her fleet to follow lat- er as soon as repairs were made to those ships that had been dam- aged by the Diana's ram.  There had been a couple of our own  men burned  on  hot pipes when they stumbled against them  during  my first hard turn, but such burns had been quickly "forgotten"  now that we were returning home, victorious from our first real  bat- tle!   So everyone believed, although I knew better,  being  well aware that in perhaps only a year there would be a force of  bat- tleships  sailing these very seas, and flying the  Imperial  flag from their flagstaffs.  As Darlanis had said, we had "won" a bat- tle, but she would "win" the war in the long run due to the  sim- ple  economic  facts of life.  Dularn just didn't  have  the  re- sources  to  ever compete in a naval "race" with  the  Empire  of California.  And the technology of Freydis' people was too primi- tive to be of much help here even if she was willing to "help".The great bulk of the Diana there floating over its reflection in the  harbor.  We had repainted the hull where the  Imperial  mis- siles  had knocked the paint off.  Other than that, there was  no visible  evidence  that  the Diana had ever been  in  battle.   I looked down into my brownette's hazel eyes, felt the sweet curves of her body against mine through the uniforms we both wore now."I  failed  you," I said to Tais as she stood  there  at  my side, the lovely white marble city of Shalimar spreading out  be- fore us.  "Darlanis will eventually end up as Empress over all of western North America despite anything Carol and I can do now.""I am not unfamiliar with the phrase," Darlanis smiled, sit- ting  down  beside me, slipping off her boots so that  she  might like  me soak her feet in the water, and adjusting her  skirt  so that she didn't have to sit on the golden links that made it  up."It  does  rather  `pucker' the skin on my  rear  end,"  she laughed back, the silver links about her throat reminding me that she  was a married woman.  I have a "weakness" for  blondes,  and Darlanis was certainly the "queen of blondes" in every sense too."Darlanis  and I were discussing the `double  standard',"  I said, giving my wife a smile as I sat there "fishing", the  early autumn  day pleasant and delightful.  The Diana would be  "ready" for sea in another couple days, ready to take its long voyage  to the south, where in the Gulf of California we would prove to  the Imperial Mexican Navy the "destructiveness" of a "battleship"...Empress of California smiled, her wet feet leaving marks there on the dock.  Carol giving me a kiss and a smile as she plopped her- self down beside me, pulling her pants up as high as she could so that she might wet her own feet in the cool waters of the harbor.As I mentioned in my previous book Carol did have a "fashion bus- iness"  in the 20th Century, and while it was not something  that made  us "rich", Carol did make a decent profit from it.  On  the other hand the one she has "here" in Arsana has given us such  an income that it now equals the pay we receive from the government.Empire in its war against Mexico.  I suspected that most of  them did not understand the "realities of power" that existed now.   I supposed I couldn't really "blame" them too much either.  For the time  being we possessed the one "ultimate weapon" against  which there was no practical defense in the Diana.  It was true that we would not possess this "advantage" over the Empire for long, as I knew  there was already a second Imperial battleship  under  con- struction  there in Trella to replace the one Tara's agent  sank."Hope  should be all right with Kathi and that  `wet  nurse' that  Maris found for her," my brownette answered, my  arm  about her  firm feminine body as she stood at my side, her ornate  uni- form as Warlady of Dularn seeming "fitting" now after everything."We'll  be back before the first snow," I smiled, seeing  my wife's hazel eyes meet mine.  Ahead of us laid a voyage far long- er  than any the Diana had ever undertaken before, a distance  of two  thousand  miles down the coastline of North America  to  the Gulf of California.  Ten days sailing at seven and a half  knots, although  the  Diana did not have the "range" to steam  that  far without  "refueling", our maximum range at best being about  fif- teen  hundred miles.  We would refuel in Sarn, again  in  Trella, and  then hopefully once again in La Paz.  I wished to  keep  our coal supplies in "reserve" as much as I could, such "fuel"  being more "efficient" than ordinary firewood.  Lamp oil was even "hot- ter" burning than coal, but its cost made it rather impractical.Carol answered, turning about, facing me, her features in  shadow against  the  glare of the sea.  I suspected that this  had  been "bugging" Carol for some time, or she wouldn't have spoken so.  I suspected  that this might have something to do with  her  coming along on this voyage and leaving our little girl back home now...I have no doubt that such practices still exist in this time, but they do not seem to be "common", perhaps due to the fact that  in this era heterosexual sex is more "available" than it was in  the 20th  Century due to the existence of legalized  prostitution  in all countries of which I have knowledge, including those ruled by the nomadic Nevadas and Wyomings.  It is noteworthy here to  note that legalized prostitution existed in the early 20th Century be- fore women obtained the vote.  Women of course being no fools did all they could to "outlaw" it for very much the same reasons that any  union member of the same era always opposed "scab"  workers.This  is clearly "understood" in this era, especially in  Dularn, where as I have mentioned earlier, men even executed one of their own Queens for "trespassing" where she should not have done.   It is noteworthy here too that "feminism" in the sense it was  known in the 20th and 21st Centuries is not "tolerated" to any  degree.Lorraine  herself notes this in her first book, as does  Darlanis in hers.  The "hostility" towards Queen Valeris in Dularn was  in part caused by the "fact" that she was an "extreme" feminist  who believed  that the world would be better off without men  in  it."I  wouldn't say that you're `over the hill' quite  yet,"  I answered,  Carol stepping forward, undoing her uniform coat,  the "jut" of her breasts beneath the thin silk blouse she wore  leav- ing little doubt that she was still a very "attractive" wench..."dry" up before we returned to Arsana.  A breast pump being  used for  this purpose, some women "milking" themselves so  that  they can "bottle feed" when necessary, although "nursing" is much more common and no doubt is "better" for the baby, it is believed now.The milk then spurting in a dribble from her nipple as I drew the plunger back to create a vacuum.  A woman's milk is far  "richer" than cow's milk, and has a high "fat" content.  This is why it is perhaps  "better" for a baby than anything else as it  also  con- tains certain "trace elements" vital for the baby's own health."Weather's getting up a bit," Sandra said to me,  indicating the barometer, which had dropped considerably since earlier  this afternoon.  We were a day out from Arsana, a couple hundred miles south now.  To the east would be Orgon, the northernmost part  of the  Empire.   The wave "pattern" now indicated a  storm  to  the west, which would be a bit of trouble given our present course as the  waves  would strike the Diana from the side, which  was  the worse place to hit given the battleship's own "top heaviness".  I was well aware that if the Diana was ever rolled more than  forty five degrees from the horizontal that she'd probably go "over"..."We'll make for the bay right here," I replied, pointing  it out  on the chart, telling Sandra to go to three quarters,  which would  increase  our speed from seven and a half knots  to  about nine.  I would ride out the storm safely at anchor in this  Impe- rial controlled bay, and then proceed onwards after it was over."Someone forgot to tell them that, your `ladyship',"  Sandra replied back, her blonde hair like a halo around her head in  the half light of the interior of the control cabin.  It was  growing dark outside, the lightning flashing in the sky to the west now."We will however keep steam up on all three boilers," I  ad- ded, seeing my wife nod.  We could hold our position with the en- gines.   While the interior of the Diana might get a bit  "uncom- fortable"  all "buttoned up" as we were, I saw no other  alterna- tive right now until we found out what the Imperials were up to."Not `good' being out in a storm like this, your  ladyship," one of the oarsmen said to my wife as they rowed her over towards the  waiting  Imperial  fleet, her  ornate  uniform  now  covered against the coming rain by a raincoat.  The lightning flashing in the sky overhead, the droplets of rain driven by the growing wind all spoke of danger.  Carol was well aware that an open boat like this was not the safest place to be in a thunderstorm, but it was a "risk" she was willing to take if she could prevent a conflict.Carol leaped up from the gunwale of the Diana's boat,  dash- ing  up the slippery rain wetted gangway, aware of the  faces  of the men staring down at her.  The crack of the lightning and  the rumble  of  the thunder like great guns adding a  bit  of  "back- ground" to the scene that she would have happily done without..."I am Carol Simmons, Warlady of Dularn," Carol spoke as  she stepped aboard Sarnian Queen, the preparations for battle  aboard the big steam frigate leaving no doubts now as to the  Imperial's plans.  The Imperial admiral nodding, standing there in the rain, the water now dripping from his hat, his raincoat.  He was an ol- der man, no doubt one well experienced in the "ways" of the  sea."There was a `rumor' I heard once that Darlanis wasn't actu- ally Tulis' daughter anyway, but some `bastard' that...," the ad- miral  answered, the rest of his words forgotten as a  midshipman knocked and entered the cabin in reply to his command to "enter"."Looks  like our boat is putting off from Sarnian Queen,"  I heard Sandra say, the captain suddenly jerking back as a thunder- ous  "BANG" seemed to hit the Diana, a strange  eerie  flickering bright  light  for just an instant seeming  to  illuminate  every thing  while I felt my hair stand on end and an electrical  shock course through me!  It was obvious that the Diana had been struck by  lightning!  Then I thought of the midshipman standing on  the top of the quickfirer turret!  Had she been struck by the bolt?"Signal Carol to return to Sarnian Queen," I said to Sandra, climbing  the ladder to the quickfirer turret.  "She can stay  on aboard until the storm is over," Sandra doing so with the carbide lamp commonly used for such purposes.  As it was now quite  dark, I had no doubts that my wife would see the message I sent to her.I took her hand, held it.  Just then naval discipline meant noth- ing to me.  Susanna Anders giving me a smile, telling me that she needed her rest.  "There was this great big flash of light, and I saw  myself lying there on the deck, the entire Diana  below  me.Then  you came and `worked' on me, and I saw this very  beautiful woman come and say to me that I had to go `back', that I couldn't `stay' with her even though I so wanted to, she was so beautiful, so nice that I didn't want to ever go back to `here' again..."  I nodded, well aware of the description, of its "meanings" here..."Any  `excitement' while I was gone?" Carol asked  the  next morning as she came aboard after spending the night aboard Sarni- an Lady thanks to the storm that had nearly taken a young  girl's life.  The Imperial ships now leaving to sail back south, to  re- turn  to their home port in Sarn.  The Diana had steam up now  on all  three boilers, the anchors drawn up short as we prepared  to follow.  The doctor had said that the midshipman would recover."She's alive, and the doc says she'll be able to resume  her duties in another day or so," I smiled back.  I didn't believe my wife would "understand" what Anders had told me.  I had no doubts now that God, Lys, She, or whoever is the Supreme Being does  ex- ist.  The "description" was similar to that which Lorraine gave.I  could  hear the bollards creak as the ropes took  up  the strain, the Diana coming to rest alongside the dock that had once been "home" to another ship, one now only a memory.  A ship  that I  had  destroyed over a year before with  my  Twentieth  Century knowledge of weapons.  Sarnian Lady had been the pride of the Im- perial Navy, the flagship of its beautiful golden Empress.  I had taken a fire pump, sprayed crudely refined oil on it, and set the ship  afire.  I recalled the "look" in Darlanis' eyes as she  had climbed aboard the stolen cargo vessel of Lorraine's.  Like those of  Hiroshima she had "seen" the "future".  She'd been  like  the native  Americans who had suddenly faced Gatling guns.   For  the time being the Diana was the "ATOMIC BOMB" of this era, a  weapon against  which there was no defense.  No nation anywhere  in  the world had a ship like the Diana.  Less than a month before I  had taught the Imperials the consequences of "facing" a "battleship"."I am surprised that she was willing to leave your  daughter in Dularn this early," Darlanis answered, pulling me around  with her.  I supposed she was a good dancer, but I'm not used to danc- ing with a woman who "leads", and I did have a bit of trouble."I suppose she `could', couldn't she," Carol answered a  bit more soberly this time.  I don't think my wife had intended to do anything "more" than just "tease" Darlanis a bit, but Darlanis is not  the sort of a woman that you ever want to "tease".   Neither is Lorraine for that matter, I might "note" here at this point."Trella," I said, seeing Sandra and Carol nod.  At a  steady two hundred miles a day the Diana did cover a lot of "ground".  I supposed we weren't as "fast" as a sailing ship in one sense, but on  the other hand the strength or direction the wind  blew  made little difference to the Diana.  It was noticeably warmer now,  a "hint" of what it would be like when we reached the Gulf of Cali- fornia.  As long as we could keep the hatches open it didn't make that much "difference", but "closed up" was something else yet...The Prime Minister of Trelandar being Lorraine's "right hand"  in more  ways than one.  She is a very "competent" woman, one who  I have no doubt is fully competent to "rule" Trelandar if  anything ever happens to Lorraine Richards, now the Queen of Trelandar and Warlady  of the Empire of California.  So far the Diana had  been doing  well, Daris Adara having told me that there were no  prob- lems with the engines or anything else.  We did keep a good guard while in port, being well aware from what Darlanis "believed" now that  an  agent of Princess Tara had been "responsible"  for  the sinking  of  the Imperial battleship on its maiden  voyage.   The Princess of course being well aware of what battleships could do.Talon  being the "home" of the great Tarls, a gigantic bird  that is capable of carrying a small woman on its back into battle.  In 2566 Lorraine "used" such birds against Dularn, and  demonstrated the  power of "air superiority" in a way that no one ever  forgot too!   Later  on Queen Dala Dai of Talon  had  "second  thoughts" about  using  her "air force" in such a way, but it  was  "proof" what the Warlady of the Empire was capable of.  This  "demonstra- tion" of her "air power" later led to her shooting by Prince Darl Jord, who we now know was a close "associate" of Princess Tara..."The  birds are only `effective' against  massed  infantry," the  Prime Minister of Trelandar answered.  Queen Dala  had  used the  birds up against Darlanis a number of years ago,  putting  a "halt"  to the Empress' attempts to take over other countries  by the use of her military power.  Due to the marriage of Lorraine's foster daughter Gayle to the Prince of Talon, Queen Dala  decided to throw in with the Empire, probably feeling that such a  "move" would be to Talon's ultimate advantage later on as it has been."Another war that got started over `female slavery',"  Carol suddenly now snapped!  Both the Imperials and the Mexicans having "raided"  each other for women for years.  Eventually things  had reached a "boiling point" and war had broken out between the  two countries.  Much as it had between Dularn and California before.Whether or not those who ruled the Empire of California could  do the same was another "question".  I recalled the "fate" of  Queen Kathis, who had been "executed" by an enraged mob for her own ac- tions  in behalf of women.  The men of this time tend not  to  be the  sort of "wimps" as was known in the 20th Century.   As  Lor- raine herself once pointed out, here men "have drawn a line", and no woman who values her life dares cross it, not even Queens..."It isn't `funny' Bob!" Carol snapped at me rather  unpleas- antly  I thought.  No doubt I had been "smiling" just a bit  here as I sat and watched while sipping at my Trelandarian wine.   The wines of Trelandar being considered to be the "best" you can get."The  societies  of your time were  `overcivilized',"  Sanda commented.  "They were `weak', unable to `resist' anyone who  was willing to make `demands'."  The "same" was not true today as  my wife knew quite well.  Carol had already fought one sword duel in Dularn  over an "issue" much like this.  While she had  "won",  I had warned her never to get herself in such a situation again..."Came  right through the hatch!" the lieutenant  cried,  her eyes a bit "wild" just then as she directed the fire control par- ty to do what they could.  The flames fortunately containable al- though we'd lost the use of the port forward catapult, the quick- firer and flamethrower on that side and more importantly the life of  one of the crew who hadn't survived the blazing oil that  had splashed about!  I saw a woman, her hair almost burned away,  her eyes filled with agony as she was half carried towards the stern, her  burned clothing sticking to her seared flesh.  I saw  a  man shake his head.  Even the Physician would be able to do little..."She  didn't  make it," Carol said to me.  We  now  had  two dead.  I recalled her eyes, the agony in them.  The Physician had done  what she could, but her burns had been too intensive.   The other  man  had been just a burned husk when we finally  got  the fire  out.  There had been some minor internal hull  damage,  but nothing serious due to the quick actions of our fire control.   I had gotten my "vengeance", but it didn't bring back the lives  of those who had died.  There had also been a certain  psychological effect upon the crew.  The Diana was no longer so "invincible".I recalled the books by Lorraine and Darlanis, the role this wom- an  had played in them.  It had been Jers' love for her that  had triggered  off the duel between Darlanis and Tara,  started  this "conflict" between the two women that had almost killed Darlanis.The sun burning down upon us, "hotter" than the summer sun of Du- larn.  The Princess of Baja was darkly tanned, almost as dark  as the  people around us.  The men in their open vests  and  leather kilts, the women in their matching halters and short skirts.  All carried  swords, Baja being a country that was not a part of  ei- ther the Empire of California or of Mexico and had no wish to be."We  have  skilled workers in wood and  metal,"  she  smiled back,  "And the damage to the wood here is not serious," she  ad- ded, referring to the inner side of the protective superstructure just  behind her.  "This will be a `decisive' weapon  only  until others like it are constructed," Lara added, giving me a smile..."A `beautiful' woman, and smart too," I whispered to  Carol, who nodded thoughtfully back.  I think Carol was aware that there was another woman who was just as "sensual" and "provocative"  as her!  The Princess of Baja carefully studying the Diana,  captain Steven at her side, explaining how everything worked on the ship."I `fascinate' you," Lara said to me as we danced.  She  was a  "better" dancer than Darlanis in that she didn't  "lead",  the rich sensual curves of her body now an erotic delight pressed  up against  mine.  While not extremely "beautiful" as such, Lara  is the sort of a woman that no man will ever forget if he meets her.I supposed that had been a "wise" move on Tais' part  considering what sort of "equipment" had been left behind by Domino Tremaine, the last "Leaderess" of the World Federation, whose dried remains were found beneath Triskelion by Princess Tara some years before."Prince Jers Bisan," he spoke, a young handsome boyish  man, his  wife standing there possessively at his side.  It was  quite "obvious" too who "wore the pants" around here.  I suppose it was natural enough considering "who" his mother had been.  The embit- tered, "vicious" Princess Tara who was now the Warlady of Mexico."You are the couple from the past, from before The War,"  he said,  Lara at his side, her arm possessively around him.   About her throat was the golden neck chain of a wife of more than three years.  Such "chains" are felt by some to "symbolize" the submis- sion of the wife to her husband.  I did not think this was "true" in this case at least.  Lara was "more" than just a wife to Jers."The Athena," Prince Jers said to me, standing on the top of the Diana's forward quickfirer turret, lowering the telescope  he had used to identify the approaching Imperial steam frigate.   "A woman that lives up to her title of `Warlady'," Jers then smiled."The Imperials seem to be holding their own," I said, seeing him  nod.  The Empire of California was well aware  that  Mexico, with its interior lines of communication, would eventually  "win" a war of this nature if it dragged on for year after year.   Only the fact that the Empire had been forced to hold Mexico at  "bay" had saved Dularn from having to face alone the Imperial might..."No doubt the people of that time will `read' of us and envy the fact that we lived in a time of `adventure'," Lorraine smiled back,  her black silk and leather trappings seeming "fitting"  on her like nothing else would be.  She is truly what she appears..."I  didn't think you were `opposed' to such  things,"  Carol said.  I don't think she ever read Lorraine's books very well.  I was well aware of the "fact" that Lorraine had once sought to end the sort of slavery that existed now, but had quickly found it to be impossible.  There is also the possibility here that the  "at- tempt" on her life made back in 2565 was related to this issue...He  was once "involved" with Maris Marn, although I think he  did find the "right" wife in Lorraine, who is quite unlike the  Queen of  Dularn.  Lorraine being a woman who "thinks like a man" in  a number of ways, as is noticeable if you read her books carefully.Carol asked.  This is not as "outlandish" as it may sound,  espe- cially not here in an era where prostitution was looked upon in a different light than it had been back in our own time.  Here  the prostitute had a "Guild", an "organization" behind her,  protect- ing her from anyone who wished her harm.  The Prostitute Guild is politically powerful throughout all of western North America now.Prostitute Guild even having a "hand" in such stuff in "training" women  to perform in such "roles".  The Guild itself is the  "in- vention" of Lara, although with considerable "aid" from Darlanis, dating back to 2555 or so from what I understand, Lara having  at that  time been falsely accused of fomenting revolt in  Trelandar against the Empire.  (I believe she might have been "guilty" to a certain degree judging from what Sanda Talen told me recently)  I suspect  that Darlanis, who is "smarter" than she looks,  decided that Lara might be "useful" to her and so decided to spare her on the basis that perhaps such a woman as Lara could be "used".   We should  remember here that Darlanis has always portrayed  herself as  being a "merciful ruler", (This is the basis of the  "SHE-RA" myth about the Empress invented by Sharon Duval) and no doubt she felt with good reason that a "grateful" Lara could be "used"  for the  purposes  of the Empire if Darlanis herself was  willing  to give Lara certain things in return that the prostitute wanted..."The `Guild' gets `sticky' about `non-members'," I said.   I was  well aware of "that", as the Prostitute Guild like any  "un- ion"  is strongly opposed to "scabs".  And they are quite  likely to express their own "displeasure" at the point of a sword to any woman who decides to "make a little something there on the side".Carol as we ate breakfast together.  Neither woman really "liked" the other, but both were well aware that they had to work togeth- er.   Carol was probably the more "hostile" of the two, but  even my wife had gotten over most of her earlier "hatred" of Lorraine."At the present time it is `illegal' to seize women of other countries as slave girls in both Dularn and the Empire," Lorraine said.   "I think we might be able to "extend" this eventually  to the point that the only `source' of slave girls will be those who commit crimes serious enough to `merit' enslavement," she added."It won't be `easy', and it will take years to do," Lorraine spoke  in level tones, her dark eyes meeting my wife's in  reply, "But I think it can be done as long as we don't fool with  things as they are like Queen Kathis once tried that time in Dularn.""Number  three slow astern, number one slow ahead one  addi- tional notch," I said, the slow "thud-thud" of the Diana's  three engines  once again echoing through the armored hull of the  bat- tleship.   No  doubt a number of the crew  had  muchly  "enjoyed" themselves in La Paz, which like all seaports is filled with  the sort of "dives" and brothels that you'd expect to find here  now.The Diana now slowly passing through the harbor, all her  hatches open  against the broiling sun that burned down upon her  armored bulk.  "Number two one notch ahead of slow," I ordered, the third engine coming on, our speed picking up just a bit now as we  fol- lowed Lorraine's steam frigate out into the Gulf of California.She also had steam up, and was making all the speed that she  was able to make.  I didn't know what she was trying to "prove",  but I had a suspicion as to what it might be.  I pushed all three  of the "repeaters" to half speed ahead, the engines quickly speeding up to our "normal cruising speed" of seven and a half knots.   If Lorraine  wanted to make a "race" out of it, I could go to  three quarters, which gave nine knots, the highest I usually push it..."Slow to between three quarters and one half," I said a  few minutes later, the ram of the Diana only a hundred yards now  be- hind the Athena.  In a good wind Lorraine would have been able to outrun the Diana, but not in a mild warm westerly like this one."Weather's getting up," I said, Sandra nodding.  There was a heavy  swell  from the west, the coastline of Mexico  there  just ahead of us.  The barometer had fallen quite low, a line of  dark clouds behind on the western horizon.  The Athena a quarter  mile of us now hoisting up more sail, obviously running for "shelter"."Stay on her," I said, hopeful that any rock would be struck by the Athena first than by us.  We were only a hundred yards be- hind the steam frigate, the lightning now flashing in the sky be- hind us.  I had withdrawn the lookout for fear of being "struck"."Coming about, dropping anchor," Sandra answered, the Athena doing so as soon as she got behind the point of jagged rock  that extended half way out into the bay.  Sandra pulling the repeaters to  "slow astern" as the Diana now approached the steam  frigate.Violent criminals were castrated as a part of their sentence.  It turned  out to be an excellent "deterrent" to  crime,  especially with the Black ghetto males, who looked upon their "manhood" in a way that reminds one of primitive barbarians, not "civilized" men as  such.  Many fearing castration more than enslavement  itself, hard as it may be to understand it by those of the 26th Century.Carol challenged.  About half were "political criminals",  people guilty of nothing more than violating some law that was a "crime" only  because the "powers that be" of that time had "decided"  to make  such  "activities" a crime.  Merely carrying  a  "concealed weapon"  could send you to prison, "unbelievable" as it may  seem today  for any of my 26th Century readers.  The United States  of America  in the last decade of the 20th Century (the 21st was  an "improvement" in some respects and "sexual freedom" was consider- ably  better) was not "the land of the free and the home  of  the brave".  It was in fact a "democratic `dictatorship'" that almost makes the worst of Darlanis' own activities seem "benevolent"  in comparison.   We hardly realize today how "bad" it was back  then so  far  as personal freedom was concerned.  This was  a  society where by 1995 under President Clinton employers were actually be- ing told by the government "who" they could hire, a society where workers almost "owned" their jobs.  A "socialist state" in "real- ity",  if not in "name" almost like that of the  U.S.S.R.   Janet Rogers  herself reintroduced much of the old "economic  freedoms" that those earlier had taken away through government action.   On the other hand her "cashless economy" gave her a degree of  "eco- nomic control" that seems unbelievable by present day standards."She outlawed the private possession of firearms," Carol re- torted.  Janet had allowed people to carry swords, even encourag- ing such.  There is something "good" to be said about such a "so- cial policy".  Janet did recognize a need for "personal defense".Janet offered considerable "bounties" for information leading  to the arrest and conviction of those in possession of firearms.  It appears  to have been quite successful judging from what we  know of that era, although complete "disarmament" proved impossible.Warlady smiled back at me.  "I personally much prefer to live  in a  social order like ours where the sword is the personal  weapon of self defense.  Where skill with weapons is still `meaningful', not just the ability to `pull a trigger' like back in our time.""It  is  nice to know that I am still  `attractive',"  Carol teased me, undoing her blouse, her bared nipples "erotic" in this culture  where a woman never revealed her nipples except  to  her husband and Physician.  The "origins" of this "taboo" are lost in time now.  "That I am still a `woman' that other men can desire.""You could stand to be `milked'," I smiled back, her breasts swollen and heavy.  Carol enjoyed having me "milk" her, the "act" in  itself tending to be sexually arousing to her, my wife  being the sort of a woman who enjoys a great of "intimacy" in marriage.The alarm whistle sounding through the length of the armored  Di- ana  as  we pulled up on the steam frigate ahead and  started  to move  around.  I saw the forward hatches being closed, the  Diana being "buttoned up" for battle.  There was little doubt that  the enemy would use fire, although it was not "effective" against us."Three of their first rates, two second rates," Carol  said, lowering the telescope.  The first rates were square rigged steam frigates, much like the Imperials, but not as well "designed"  as Lorraine's ships were in that they still lacked the top gallants.The second rates were simple "sailers", carrying that odd  combi- nation of a square and fore and aft rig that the Mexicans seem to like.  We were now up alongside the Athena, the crew of the Impe- rial  flagship waving and cheering us on.  I "assumed" that  they were  cheering us, judging from their activities, although  given the  constant heavy "thud-thud" noise of the triple  engines  and everything  else the interior of the Diana when "buttoned up"  as we were now is not a quiet place by any means, I can assure you.Of the two only the Women had any interest in exploration, in be- ing anything more than just a life form much like the ants  unno- ticed there beneath our feet.  Perhaps "war" is the price we  pay for being an aggressive, assertive life form that perhaps someday will seek the stars if the Priestesses of Lys ever do allow it..."Once  again we stand together," Carol said, her hand on  my shoulder, her hazel eyes meeting mine.  I thought of the Arena at Trella, of the sands, the sun burning down.  Of a brownette naked but  for a bit of leather, a sword glistening there in her  hand.I  saw the bow of the Diana blazing with burning oil,  heard  the sound of the forward quickfirers, all four forward and the turret above our heads.  Fifteen missiles a second falling like a deadly hail on his decks.  The ram hit just astern, the flamethrower now spraying its deadly stream of fire.  He was done for even  before the  Diana broke free to seek her second victim.  The second  had come about to try to face us, the third following at his heels...I reversed the engines, hit him with both flamethrowers, the  Di- ana backing away at full power.  Daris Adara was good down in the engine room throwing those levers over in that steamy oven  below decks.  She and her sweating crew now quick to follow my orders."Third one now," I said, Carol at my side, watching, the Di- ana now again racing forward to meet her "enemy" like a  charging iron  clad monster.  It was hard to see through the  flames  that burned  before the control room slits, the odor of  burning  lamp oil  heavy in the air.  Curses from above left no  doubts  either that  some  of it had come in through the firing  slit  over  our heads.  Midshipman Anders having a rather "surprising" vocabulary for one so "young" and pretty, I laughed to my wife just then.The  two second rates running for safety, the Athena charging  on down  at them.  Behind us now three blazing ships, terrified  men leaping  into the sea to escape the leaping flames as  the  Diana came about to view the horrors that our flamethrowers had caused."An `impressive' victory," Lorraine said, standing there  on the  deck of her flagship.  Behind us burned the last of the  two second rates, the crews having been put ashore and the ships both set  ablaze by the Athena's own flamethrowers.  The  Diana  lying alongside like a great monster of the deep, the painted hull  now burned in places from the blazing oil that had fallen upon her."No injuries worth noting," Sandra said to me when I stepped back aboard the Diana, the open hatches now clearing the interior of the odor of burning lamp oil.  Carol giving me a smile as  she stood  there beside the captain.  The crew of the Diana  standing there  watching, their own "silence" a tribute to the  dead  we'd left behind there floating among the drifting embers of the three steam  frigates.  I recalled the "end" of Sarnian Lady  the  year before from the use of a flamethrower.  The "reactions" of Darla- nis  to the "use" of such a weapon.  The Mexicans had  been  much the same.  I thought of another era, the "use" of another weapon."Be `dangerous'," Lorraine said.  I supposed it would be  to take  a captured Mexican merchantman into their harbor.  I  could think of nothing else that would get us "inside" the chain.   Al- low us to take the fort by surprise with a force large enough  to defeat its own defenders before assistance could be sent from the town inside the harbor.  If the chain could be "opened", then the Diana could enter, and cause enough destruction against an unpre- pared foe to jolt the Mexican Emperor into signing a peace treaty with Darlanis.  So far the Imperial land forces with the  Nevadas had not been able to win any substantial victories against  Mexi- co.  Even the tarls of Talon had been of little "effect" here.  I supposed  they were an "annoyance", but so far the Imperials  had not  found them really "effective" in the military sense  against the superior numbers that the Mexican Empire could field in turn.Sandra  and the two ship's lieutenants having gone with  my  wife along with virtually everyone else in Lorraine's fleet.  I remem- bered  the time that Carol and I had once "discussed"  just  this should she ever die in battle.  She had "suggested" that  perhaps Maris Marn might make me a suitable mate.  I supposed that it was "possible", but there would never be "another" like my Carol..."They do have quickfirers like us," the Warlady pointed out, a pale sickle of a moon there in the sky to the east breaking the gloom  of the night.  The Diana a half mile back like some  great monster of the deep.  The merchantman's sails gleaming in the dim light left no doubt as to the "nationality" of the stolen vessel."I'm going to turn away at a third," I answered, seeing  her nod.   I would go to full power on all, the helm hard to port  as the ship turned away.  I suspected that the maximum range of  the steam  catapults might be as much as five hundred yards if not  a bit more.  Those aboard the Athena were good for five fifty now."Now back that main sail before we run up on to that log  chain!" the Queen of Trelandar suddenly "snapped" then, jolting  everyone out of their own musings!   "And if you don't speak Spanish, keep your damm yaps shut or I'll dammed know the reason `why' later!"The  men on shore were yelling something back in reply,  the ship  now  drifting closer.  In another few seconds it  would  be drifting up against the barrier, the brownette knew as she nocked an arrow on her bowstring.  A drifting cloud now hiding the Moon.She thought of the child she might never see again, of a life now six centuries in the past.  "Why am I here risking my life?"  Ca- rol mused to herself.  Fighting in behalf of a "cause" that meant next to nothing to those of Dularn.  "Just a God damm mercenary!"The Mexicans falling back, while quickfirers from the fort  above uselessly peppered the deck of the ship and the dark waters!   It being obvious now that the Mexican weapons could not be depressed far enough to fire directly upon a force below the fort itself."Don't let them close that gate!" she heard Lorraine cry,  a flurry  of arrows and crossbow bolts dropping the  Mexicans  like toy soldiers there above them.  She was aware of that  "numbness" she'd  felt before in combat as she scrambled up the  rocks,  the same  sensation  that this was really all nothing but  a  "dream" from which she'd soon awaken to find herself safely back at home.Carol  drew back the arrow, released, felt the "jar" of  the compound  bow  in her hand, saw the man she'd shot  fall  in  the darkness there beside the gate.  A missile of some sort shot from the  fort's battlements zipping on by her to strike  an  Imperial crossbowman.  She heard his "cry" as she nocked another arrow  on her bowstring, returning the Mexicans' fire.  Lorraine and a  few of her own people now were fighting with swords there at the gate against a superior foe.  Only the Warlady's awesome skill winning the  "match" for them as the Mexicans fell back before this  tall black clad "demon" in human form that no swordsman could match..."Dianas!   To Me!" Carol cried, leading their  assault,  now meeting  the Mexicans herself blade to blade, driving them  back, while  others on the battlements poured a steady stream  of  mis- siles at any they could tell were "foe", not "friend".  The melee was  such  that  in the darkness that it was  difficult  to  tell friend from foe, although as the Mexicans were darker skinned for the  most part you could usually tell one from the other  without too much trouble in the light of the torches.  On the other  hand some of the Imperials were as "dark" as any Mexican, and no doubt more than one died from "friendly fire" there in the darkness in- side  the fort.  Carol drawing on all her skills as she  led  the assault, the men and women around her both Imperial and  Dularni- an, former "enemies" now just  all "friends" facing a common foe.I liked Maris Marn, and no doubt she liked me, but she wasn't any thing like Carol, and I couldn't really see being married to  the Queen of Dularn even if Maris was willing to marry me, which  she might not be from all I knew.  The "conditioning" of the  Priest- esses having worn off long ago, leaving Maris much as she  was..."Another who has died for a `cause' few of us `understand'," the  brownette answered bitterly.  "In the `service' of  one  who was just last year our feared enemy," the Warlady of Dularn  then added,  the  tone of her voice doubtlessly leaving no  doubts  in Lorraine's mind as to her true feelings about this entire affair."They  request that we engage a relief column marching to  attack the fort from the town!"  I nodded, well aware of the Diana's ca- pabilities.  What  the three catapults and twenty  quickfirers  a side  could "do" to men exposed out in the open.  I didn't  think the Mexicans knew much of the Diana's capabilities and firepower."I  expect `that' taught them a little `respect',"  Lorraine said,  lowering  the 8x50 night glass.  She had  seen  enough  to guess  at the rest hidden there in the darkness.  No  doubt  some had survived the six hundred deadly missiles fired from the Diana in a space of ten seconds, but not enough to be a "threat" now to those holding the fort.  The fort's own weapons would be adequate to "repel" any relatively small attacking force if well served.Had it not been for the Diana and Queen Freydis, no doubt  Darla- nis' plans would have been successful in "isolating" Dularn  from the lands about it.  Carol still "wondered" about that.  Lorraine was a far "smarter" woman than Darlanis.  Far more "dangerous"..."We  could do `better' with the catapults, sir...,"  Susanna said to me, her eyes looking questioningly into mine as the Diana approached  her  next "target", the last one now a  flaming  pyre that  lit  up the harbor like a great bonfire.  I was  using  the flamethrowers,  not the catapults, being well aware of  the  fact that one lucky "hit" through a hatch could be our destruction..."I will lead a boarding party, `take' it for you, sir,"  she said.  I wished she hadn't volunteered.  There would  doubtlessly be crossbowmen.  I remembered Shari Johnson, recalled seeing  her body  wrapped up in a hammock  to be tipped over the side of  the North Star with a shot at her feet to speed her on her way to her final  resting  place at the bottom of the sea.  I  recalled  the words  of the "last rites" as Carol had spoken them that day  now so long ago.  She too had been young and beautiful like this one."Do  so,"  she answered, signaling the Diana as it  came  in closer, the black smoke of its coal fires rising up into the star sprinkled  sky  while the Moon, only a few days  from  "new"  now gleamed  down  upon them in the eastern sky.  A sky  now  growing just a bit "pale" there on the distant horizon as the rays of the sun started peeking just a bit over the curve of the Earth.   The young  midshipman watching the men leaping on to the curved  hull of the battleship, others on the bow of the Diana waiting to take hold of the ropes to tow the enemy battleship away from its dock.A man clutching at an arrow in his shoulder falling from the deck of the enemy battleship into the waters alongside the vessel.   A woman leaping into the water, keeping him afloat while others now lifted him back on to the ship.  Puffs of steam from the  forward turret  telling of the Diana's return fire as the battleship  now started to back away, taking up on the tow rope that joined it to the enemy battleship.  The teenage blonde crouching down to  make less of a target for herself as she clung to a hatch handle,  the dock falling back as the Diana now dragged the other ship away..."Make my husband more aware of his `responsibilities,"  Lor- raine answered with a smile in return, regarding the still lovely Dularnian  Warlady in the now growing light as the first rays  of the  sun  lit up the eastern sky, the stars mostly dim  and  pale with  Venus  bright in the east.  "`Both' to me and the  child  I bear."  The Imperial Warlady well aware of the other woman's  own feminine attractiveness, of her provocative features that left no doubts in anyone's mind that she was fully and truly "female"...It  would  be "easy" to sink the enemy ship, but  such  a  vessel could  be  "valuable" if we could take it as a prize  instead  of just sinking it here in the harbor.  I wasn't too sure as to  the depth of water here, and it was possible that the Mexicans  might be able to "raise" the ship later and make the necessary repairs."That  should `hold' them," I spoke, seeing  the  midshipman nod.   I had rammed the other ship just about where  her  boilers would  be, I guessed.  I suspected that "this" might be  "enough" to encourage the Mexicans aboard to abandon their ship to us..."Oh Lys, we ask your mercy upon the souls of these who  have died,  in  the hope that you will look upon them with  mercy  and gather  them to your loving bosom as the `mother' of  all  living things." I heard Carol say as she spoke the "last rites" over our own  dead.   We had purchased our "victory" at a  high  price,  I thought then...  "We ask too, oh dear loving Lys, that you  grant us  who live the wisdom to know good from evil, that we may  keep your commandments, that we may live our lives in the hope that we will  be gathered to your bosom after death to be forever  united with you for all time."  I recalled what Lorraine had written.  I wondered if she had perhaps seen "God" there on the arid  surface of  Mars.  I knew the Warlady was no longer the "agnostic"  she'd been back in the Twentieth Century when I'd often spoken to her.Stepping  up beside Carol, I then said, "We mourn those  who have  fallen,  but we must also remember the `good' they  did  in their lives, the memories we hold of them, and remember that they did  not die in vain, that the `cause' for which they fought  was `just' regardless of what the Scribes someday write of our acts.""We should be in sight of Dularn by tomorrow," Carol said to me,  leaning back against the observation deck railing on top  of the  forward quickfirer turret.  The captured Mexican  battleship following close behind.  The air was "chill", the leaves all  now "turned"  on the trees there to starboard, the sun bright in  the cloud  sprinkled November sky.  It had taken us some time to  re- turn,  what  with the temporary repairs we'd had to make  to  the prize and the fact that it could only run on its portside engine."It  is not likely that the Lorr will ever return," I  said, having  thought this over now for some time.  The Lorr and  their own  servants, the lovely Women of Mars had gotten  the  "PORTAL" device from which centuries later they would develop into a means of eventually crossing space without the need to use space ships."I had a little `accident'," my wife answered, diverting the heavy set blond haired dentist's question.  I recalled how  Carol had gotten that scar in her duel with the Imperial Warlady.   For a  year  and a half Carol and I had lived in another  "time",  in another "world" far different from this one.  A world where  guns were  almost unknown, where men and women carried swords.   Where "government"  played only a very "minor" role in people's  lives.It is perhaps best now that those of this era do not believe what lies  in the future.  Not that it is likely that they  would  be- lieve me, but I have no desire to risk the safety of those living six  centuries from now.  We know that Carol's three  novels  did survive, that she was responsible in her own way for many of  the things  we found there in the future, just as Lorraine  was  "re- sponsible" for Janet Rogers, who will be ruler of the world...Then suddenly we were "plucked" out of our own time, our own era, and "dropped" into a strange hostile world over five centuries in our future.  A world where Man had fought a great WAR with  alien beings  from  another world and lost back in  the  21st  Century.The "world" of the 26th Century was a strange place, in many ways  much like that of Rome at its glory.  A social order  where capital ships of the navies were still heavy triremes, where  the most "advanced" missile weapons depended upon human muscle power.The sword was the preferred personal weapon of choice, and  human slavery was commonplace everywhere.  The common form of political organization  was a constitutional monarchy with Queens now  pre- ferred due perhaps to half mythical legends of a "woman" who  had once ruled the entire world way back in the Twenty First Century.Another is meeting up with the Lorr and the Women in an era  when you least expected it.  A time before the Priestesses of Lys were "founded" by Janet Rogers.  A time when Man still felt himself to be the only form of intelligent life in the entire solar  system."It was a nightmare, Kathi," I said.  "Just a nightmare."  A woman of the Royal Guard now bursting through the door, her drawn sword  gleaming in the light from the bedroom windows where  they overlook the harbor there below the palace.  She followed by  two more, their polished steel helmets and chain mail over their warm fur lined leather jackets making them look much like the toy sol- diers I used to play with as a girl back in Sana many years ago."Mistress should see a Priestess," La-ra smiled in reply,  a heavy  shawl over her shoulders against the late winter chill  no fire could dispel here in the Royal Palace of Dularn.  What those of the past had once called the Island of Vancouver long ago now."It `was' a bad nightmare," I "smiled", the guardswomen  now leaving,  nodding to themselves in agreement.  This had not  been the first time they'd heard the terrified screams of their Queen, although this had been the worst nightmare I'd had so far now..."It's snowing outside," I said, more to make  "conversation" now  than anything else, the white flakes drifting down  from  an iron gray sky.  It was the middle of March, with spring hopefully on  the way.  I was "tired" of winter, of the snow and the  cold."What  your majesty needs..," Kathi "ventured", bringing  in my  breakfast while La-ra busied herself washing me down,  "Is  a man to keep her `warm' at night," the grin on her face leaving no doubt in my mind as to her own sleeping "arrangements" right now.I  nodded, smiling, well aware that High Priestess Tais would  be bringing no more people from the "past" up into our own time, nor would the Simmons, a couple from the 20th Century, ever be "back" again  now that they had served their purpose here in our era  of restoring the "balance of power" between Dularn and California...I  had their baby daughter Hope, a lovely child now eight  months old  who had been left with me to raise, Carol having said to  me that she did not wish to raise a child back in the era from which they had come, not with what they knew about everything to come.I had spent several years in slavery in California, mostly on  an estate  in Trelandar, where my golden blonde hair and green  eyes had made me extremely "popular" with men, although fortunately  I never  suffered too much "abuse" at their hands due to the  rules and policies of Lady Lana, whose name had been on my collar then."The  blue woolen tunic and hose?" Kathi asked, holding  the items up for my attention.  My sword and dagger in their  sheaths were fixed to my weapons belt slung there on the bedpost, a Queen of Dularn if "wise" sleeping always with "weapons" close to hand.This "last" had come as a big surprise to both Darlanis and  Lor- raine last winter, when Sharon Duval, the Queen of Orgon, had let it  be "known" that she favored Dularn over the Empire in a  dis- pute  over whether Orgon should be "Californian" or  "Dularnian"."It is a `work' of the `Ancients'," the man said, one of the caste  of Builders, as he supervised his labor gang now  pounding away with hammers and chisels against the reinforced concrete  of the vault like structure they'd found outside the city of Arsana.There  was, in my opinion, little "value" in digging up the  past although I suppose that those of the "learned" castes might  dif- fer  with  me on that.  I am of the Warrioresses, a  "caste"  not noted for "intellectual" qualities, but for the blood we  "shed", the battles that we fight against the foes of our lovely island.Like  the Lorr they had even possessed the ability to travel  be- tween  worlds, although this last had been their "downfall"  when Mankind  had attempted to destroy the Lorr with a gigantic  comet "redirected" so that it would strike Mars and destroy the "ants"."After five centuries there won't be `much'," I answered.  I was  well aware that the ancients had possessed secrets  of  pre- serving dead bodies that we couldn't match today, but even so  it was rare to find a body from that era still more than just bones.I had seen the tears in her eyes when she had held her child  for the  last  time and then placed her in my arms, well  aware  that here  at least she might live out her life without fear  of  what lived there beneath the surface of Mars.  The horrid Lorr that in 2047  A.D. would come close to destroy Mankind in a great  WAR...Builders said to me as one of my warrioresses ushered him into my private chambers where I was now enjoying my dinner.  The thought going  through  my mind that whatever the "news"  was,  it  could "wait" until I finished eating.  The snow having quit, with a wet rain having replaced it, the wind having changed into the  south.In the other coffin had been the body of Carol, clad in a  metal- lic mesh, a sword at her hip, the grayness of the hair leaving no doubts  in my mind that they had lived for a long time after  re- turning to their own time back in the year 1991.  I took the book from his hands, his face now blurring a bit before me as I turned away, not wishing him to see the tears that then filled my eyes."It is `late', your majesty," La-ra said, yawning, her  eyes heavy with sleep as she held a heavy shawl about herself.  I  had read much of the book, of things that I had known, but not really "understood"  as such.  It had been a story of love, of a  couple so  deeply in love that they died together, with their last  wish only  being to be buried together side by side in a tomb on  what was then the Island of Vancouver, near what they knew would some- day be the city of Arsana, the capital of Dularn.  In my own time even my own Warrioresses, the finest  fighting women in all Trelandar, were "terrified" of  the ruins of Los Angeles.  A short  foot- note  by Janet Rogers indicates that she carried out  their  last wishes for them, although she did not of course know just "why"."warm" the day, although it was still "better" than it'd been the day before when we'd found the last remains of the "Simmons" in a tomb less than a mile from the city of Arsana.  The children  who had  discovered the tomb no doubt having little understanding  of "why" such a find told a tale that left no doubts of things now.The guardswomen on duty coming to "attention" as we passed  them, such women commonly being of the Caste of Warrioresses,  "profes- sional fighting women" in a way that was rarely known in  earlier eras.  It is not a matter of "skill", but more one of "attitude".She has in the past manufactured explosives, and attempted at one time  to use the Tarls of Talon as an "air force" against my  own country.   I suspected that Sharon had a "story" to tell me,  one that  I had some suspicion here that I might not want  to  "hear" just now!  This "visit" of hers to me made me "wonder" just a bit what  was going on in Orgon?  And Sharon seemed to be  scared  of something!  Could she have started "something" with Darlanis now?"I  wonder if Man will ever be `free' again,"  Sharon  said, standing there by the window, looking out at her ship floating in the harbor, the sails now furled on the yards, the crew no  doubt hoping to visit the "fleshpots" and Arsana's dockside  "dives"...No doubt the "hip swingers" would be delighted with lusty sailors and their silver coins, while the inn keepers would get their own share and drunken seamen would be a "problem" for the city's  own guardsmen to deal with.  The North Star, her yards bare of sails, a near sister to the ship that Sharon had used to come here now."I'm `content' with what I `have'," I answered, not  knowing what else to "say" just then.  I did like Sharon a lot, almost as if  she was a younger sister, the two of us more "alike" in  some ways than even Gayle and I had been.  Both Sharon and I came from "broken" homes, with step mothers that could never take the place of the mothers that we'd known.  My mother had died when I was  a young girl, while Sharon's had become a drunken sot from the emo- tional abuse that her father had heaped upon during the marriage."There is a group in Orgon who wants me to declare our  `in- dependence' of the Empire like Lorraine has with Trelandar,"  the young  Queen  spoke, standing there at my side as I  watched  the black coal smoke rising up in the distance beyond the city walls."I will go aboard the Imperial ship as soon as it drops  an- chor," I said, Tori nodding as she stood there in her armor.  Her dark  eyes meeting mine in a wordless "understanding" as I  stood there  on the quay, the Imperial first rate now coming  in  under steam, the smoke rising from its funnel up into the cloud spotted sky.  It was late afternoon, chill, a shiver now going through me as  I thought of "what" I might "face" there aboard the  Empress' own flagship.  That Darlanis would be "FURIOUS" I could take  for granted, I expected, Sharon having had no "comprehension" of  the seriousness of the "insult" she'd done to her own foster mother."Don't  wait  for me," I snapped, grabbing for  the  gangway railing as the boat rocked beneath me, an Imperial officer  look- ing down at me from above.  I could hear orders being barked, the muffled sound of feet there on the deck above, the crew no  doubt being gathered now to "honor" Dularn's Queen as she came  aboard.The crew, the officers of Sarnian Queen all standing there wooden faced,  no doubt well aware of "what" had been done to their  own beloved Empress!  Darlanis is quite popular with her own  people, I might note here, much more so with men than she is with women.My own band on shore now retorted with the Imperial  anthem, my orders being carried out to the letter to maintain  "protocol" here regardless of what happened.  The very "presence" of  course of the Astarte leaving no doubts as to "where" Sharon had gone...The young Queen of Orgon stripped naked, and bound by her  wrists to a chain hanging down from the rough stone ceiling overhead.  A trio of three naked teenagers, one boy, two girls, cowering  down in a corner of the room now huddled together in their own terror.I saw Sharon "jerk" against her bonds, twisting about, "cry- ing out" now, the lash drawing blood now as Darlanis "struck" the same place that she had struck before.  The "snap" of the whip as it struck the young Queen of Orgon seeming to "echo" off the cold stone  walls  of the palace dungeon, the various  instruments  of torture  here in this room making me "shudder" at the thought  of what might be "done" to a helpless victim.  The rack, the  thumb- screw, the devices to twist cords tighter and tighter about one's head, all things that Dularnian Queens in the past had used  upon their  enemies  to force from them "confessions" of  "guilt",  to force  from  unwilling lips "secrets" from those who  had  fallen into their hands.  My late husband had performed such  "tortures" upon  people with an almost sadistic glee, but I had  never  done so,  although Tori had once forced "secrets" from the lips of  an Imperial spy who had been in the "pay" of the Imperial Empress...Sharon herself hung sobbing, a beaten animal, no longer  the proud young Queen she'd been.  The three Orgonian teenagers  cow- ering in the corner of the dungeon before my captain wide eyed, a look  of "terror" on their faces that left no doubts as to  their feelings!   Darlanis had not said what she "planned" to  "do"  to them, and I knew that even if she wished their lives, there would be  nothing that I could "do" about it now.  She is a  "dominant" woman, one "born to rule", unlike me, and I could only submit  to her wishes, whatever they might be here or risk another "war"..."She  is an `Empress'," Tori said to me as I shared a  drink with her there in my private chambers, the fine "state dinner" we would have had having been canceled by my order at Darlanis'  re- quest.  I no longer looked upon Darlanis quite the way as before."There is a saying, `spare the whip, spoil the child'," Tori smiled  back.   "I remember my mother saying it when she  had  to punish me," Tori grinned, her dark eyes and walnut hair reminding me so much of one once dear to me.  A woman now only dried  flesh and bones lying in a stainless steel coffin outside of Arsana...Bob  Simmons' "nickname" for her of "Torrid Tori" wasn't too  far off  if a "private joke" I'm glad Tori never learned the  "truth" about...  I doubt very much if she would have "appreciated" being compared to the original "Torri Wells", who was something like  a "hip swinger".  A "prostitute" by the "standards" of our society."The North Star will be commissioning," Tori said to me as I nodded.   The ship had undergone a complete "refit", and was  now ready  for sea once again to carry out my orders and commands  as the Queen of Dularn.  Pirates were still a "problem", and while I had no doubt that Queen Freydis was telling me the truth that she had forbidden such "activities" among her own people living there to the north of Dularn, still we did "have" a "pirate problem"...I  didn't need to mention to Tori, a Warrioress, that  there  was always the "risk" that her lovely daughter might just end up sewn up in a hammock with a catapult shot at her feet and tipped  over the side of the ship after a battle.  Such a young woman had end- ed up just exactly that way a year ago when we'd "rescued" Sharon from barbaric pirates holding her for a ransom south of Alaska.She  had taken the "whipping" she got for it rather  well,  which spoke  much of her, although I hoped Tori realized that aboard  a ship of war she would be under naval discipline, which can be and often is "stricter" than anything civilians as a rule ever know."Like  to take another voyage with me up to Sana?" I  smiled back.  Such a voyage is a little over a hundred miles, and  ships like  the North Star usually make it in less than a  day.   There had been a "bit of wind" last fall when I took Tori with me,  and the North Star had been taking the seas heavy off her bow,  while the  ship had been rolling heavily in the "troughs"  between  the waves  as we made our way north.  For me it had been a chance  to get a little "fresh air", have a deck beneath my feet again, even if the North Star was now "obsolete" in this age of armored steam frigates, but poor Tori had seen it much "differently" than me..."I'd  better get `going' before my husband decides to  `bed' our slave girl and Diane disappears for the next six hours," Tori smiled  back,  then taking her leave of me.  Kathi coming  in  as soon as she left with a dinner tray for me, La-ra there with her, carrying  Hope  there in her arms like a lovely little  doll.   I thought I would have La-ra sleep with me tonight, with orders  to awaken  me  if she heard me now starting to whimper or  cry  out."Another  would  have `exploited' the  situation,"  Darlanis said to me as we shared a breakfast the next morning, Sharon sit- ting there in bed, watching us, nibbling at her own food, keeping her thoughts to herself.  No doubt she was well medicated for the pain, I thought, although I suspected that there would be  scars.Dressed in a woolen robe, her golden hair tousled from sleep, she didn't seem so "impressive" then.  Just another "big blonde" like many  I've seen here in Dularn.  Bob Simmons once said  that  she looked  like a woman called "Shannon Tweed" in the 20th  Century.His  wife on the other hand said she reminded her of a "soap  op- era"  actress by the name of Brenda Epperson.  One can take  this as  you wish, although both of them said I looked like  Katherine Kelly Lang, another soap opera actress of the Twentieth Century."answered" her back in level tones, aware that Darlanis no  doubt had  good reason for what she did here.  I wouldn't  have  "done" what she had either with the three teenagers, although I had  un- derstood just "what" she was doing here, as had my friend Tori."Not the `technocratic dictatorship' of Janet Rogers," I an- swered back with a "smile" matching hers.  If Darlanis wished  to discuss  political philosophy with me I would be quite  happy  to oblige her.  I had no doubts that our own "system" was  superior."Must  be an `odd' marriage," Tori said to me as  we  walked together out on the quay that overlooks the harbor.  The  Astarte and the Sarnian Queen floating there at anchor along with half  a dozen  other vessels, most of them trading schooners of one  sort or another.  The North Star was setting up her yards, the crew as such still a bit "green", I noticed as I enjoyed the brisk air."A Nevada and a woman like her?" I smiled, "wondering" a bit myself.  The men of the Nevadas view women almost as  "property", whereas  a woman like Darlanis would likely see a marriage  as  a relationship between two equals, much as any Dularnian would now."I hope this time it will be better," I smiled back, the Im- perial Warlady's dark eyes meeting mine.  Unlike with Darlanis, I felt  a sense of "fear" of this woman, her total absolute  "domi- nance" like an aura that seemed to radiate from her as she  stood there.   Even five months pregnant, her belly swollen, she  still seemed  to give the impression that single handed she could  have conquered  Dularn itself.  She is a "legend", said by many to  be the greatest swordswoman of all time, a Warrioress beyond compare although I believe this last is not true, as Carol did manage  to outwit her there in Trelandar, although only "tactically" as I do have no doubt that Lorraine was the superior military commander.Once long ago we were lovers, but he wished another, a slim  dark haired woman of the Physicians, who he later married.  The "fact" that Lorraine herself is "slim", dark haired perhaps indicates he prefers that sort of a woman, although I suspect that my own  am- bitions at that time of making "something" of myself had quite  a bit to do with things.  In my early years I was a bit of a bitch.It is, I think, partly her "attire", usually black silk  and leather, the high black leather spike heeled boots she wears, the long flowing skirt, the leather vest and trappings, the hats, the veil that conceals the "harshness" of her features.  She is not a beautiful woman, although I suspect Jon considers her attractive.Then there are the "legends", the story of a woman who stood  be- fore  an Imperial Legion commanded by Princess Tara, raised up  a weapon from another world, and caused them all to retreat in fear of  "what" stood there before them.  I remember the duel  between her and Carol, of whose skills with a sword I took such pride in."The `end' of a civilization based upon ideals I gave to a  woman who died over five hundred years ago," the Queen of Trelandar now said to me.  "A return to earlier ideals of men who lived back in the Eighteenth Century when life was much `simpler' than now."Darlanis' and Sharon's own ships, but just then there was but two women standing there facing each other, with only "ghosts" of the past for company.  Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine, others beside me, while beside Lorraine stood Janet Rogers herself, her own "child" in a way, Lorraine having been the "mother" of a civilization  we now  "studied" in school, read about in books, some  to  "admire" while others saw it only as the last gasp of a technocratic soci- ety that had died in fire, burned to ashes never to ever return."You  remind me of a cat with kittens," I smiled to Tori  as my  captain of the Royal Guard checked on her guardswomen to  see that everything was "perfect".  Tori is a very "competent" woman, if a bit of a "perfectionist" in some ways about her guardswomen.There  were a lot of people here in Arsana alone who had no  love for either Darlanis or Lorraine, and Prince Serak of the  Nevadas was an arch enemy of the Wyomings, which only added to Tori's own problems of seeing that nothing happened to anyone under her pro- tection.   We  had already had a "problem" last night  with  some drunken sailors off the Athena and Sarnian Lady, the "charge"  of rape the barmaid had issued against one of the sailors off Sarni- an  Lady something that would require the most delicate  of  han- dling.  The man maintained that he believed she was a prostitute, which the woman might have "been" despite the fact she was not  a member of the "Guild", there being a number of "free lancers" who refused  to pay the "dues" that the Prostitute Guild required  of its members.  The investigating guardsmen had told Tori that  the woman's skirt was as "short" as any "hip swinger's", and that  it was known that she did at times "sell" her "favors" to men.  This last  in my opinion indicating that she probably "was"  what  the Imperial sailor had maintained she was, although I thought it was rather "stupid" of him not to determine her true "status"  before he had sexual intercourse with her there up above the bar room..."What do you `think' of that `incident' last night?" I  said to Tori as she finished checking her women's appearance to see it was as "good" as it could be.  Darlanis had her own "guardswomen" with her, as did Sharon, and we also now had Lorraine's too,  all of whom of course had their first loyalties to their own monarch."The city guardsmen who interviewed her said that her  skirt was way up to `here'," I smiled, indicating the "spot" on my  own thighs.  Such a skirt would have been only a few inches below  my crotch.  Those of prostitutes are often of that "height", I knew."That is a rather `interesting' idea, if not all that  `mod- ern',"  I smiled back, the "look" on Tori's attractive face  just then leaving no doubts that she would have voiced an "answer"  to my own "comment" in return had I not "been" the Queen of Dularn."If you wish this can wait for another time," I said to her, aware that I had "interrupted" something that was none of my  own business.  There was also the "issue" that I'd once been Jon's to the point that he'd proposed marriage to me.  Whether or not  Jon still had feelings for me was an issue that might worry Lorraine."I `assume' that it is `important' or you wouldn't be here," the  Imperial  Warlady answered, slipping off Jon's lap  to  seat herself beside him.  She wore a pair of silken pajamas, black,  a bit of attire that looked rather good on her despite her  swollen belly.  Lorraine being the sort of a woman that becomes more  at- tractive after you've known her for a while, I might "note" here."The `answer' depends upon the sort of society in which  you wish to live," Lorraine answered.  "In the 20th Century this very question was decided upon the basis of `employee rights', a quite natural consequence of the type of political system in use  then.Tori was good at "small unit tactics", things like that, but  she wasn't really a heavy "thinker" as such, her husband having  mar- ried her no doubt because she had a very attractive face and Tori was rather full in the bust, which some men do like in a woman..."There were countries like that back in my time, but none of them were   ever   economically  `successful'  even   with   our   own technology."  Janet Rogers did have government "control" of "nat- ural monopolies", but she never attempted to actually "run"  peo- ples' lives or directly regulate the "activities" of most people."And  in a `democratic' society they will `vote'  for  their own  `short term' interests despite the consequences in the  long run," Lorraine smiled.  "That is why it was `necessary' to design a political system as I did then that would allow a  considerable amount of freedom, but yet would not be subject to the "whim"  of the voters."  I saw Tori nod thoughtfully, and then glance at me."An `elected legislature', a monarch with an absolute veto," the Trelandarian Queen smiled back.  "The `representatives of the people'  pass laws, and then one of `us' must decide  whether  or not the law is wise or stupid," she smiled, seeing me nod in  re- ply  back.  I knew she had the power which I didn't  to  "repeal" laws once passed, something I'd been "pushing for" ever since I'd understood what the true "role" of the Queen was here in Dularn."slavery" were something that few people in this era shared.  Not that  Tori or her husband ever "mistreated" their slave  girl  so far as I knew, but the wench was being kept as a sort of "unpaid" housemaid,  servant,  and "sexual partner" for  Tori's  Physician husband when she wasn't "available" or in the "mood" for "sex"..."This  is kind of `embarrassing'," Tori said as she  removed her uniform, a well filled halter cradling her breasts.  She had, I thought to myself, a "20th Century" figure, the "ideal" of lat- er eras being smaller breasted, "larger" in the hips and  thighs.I recalled what Prince Paul of the Wyomings and I had once "done" there in the forest, the gentle breeze rustling the leaves in the broughs  overhead,  the birds chirping away, the  little  animals running  about.  The "sounds" that our unicorns had made as  they watched us.  The "feel" of his body against mine as we made love."I've always looked upon you as being `more' than that," she answered, turning her back now to me as she removed her clips and slipped  down her strap.  I wondered again "why" women wore  such "attire" beneath their clothing.  Why the "exposure" of the  nip- ple was something so "forbidden" when the "breast" itself wasn't?Carol Simmons having once told me that back in her own time  when she  was  an "exotic dancer" (Such exist today,  but  only  slave girls do it!) that it was "illegal" for a woman to "expose" those parts of her body in a public place.  This of course implies that perhaps  our own "style" of clips and strap commonly worn by  the women  of  the "civilized" nations of North  America  dates  back somehow to the 20th Century, or perhaps slightly "later", as such styles being quite "commonplace" in the "time" of Janet Rogers."She  `forgot' to `shave'," La-ra whispered to me, her  dark eyes meeting mine.  Tori having a dark "shadow" that left  little "doubt" there at the junction of her thighs that she hadn't  done so for several days at least.  Being a blonde, I can go some time without "shaving", as my own pubic hair is a light golden "down".I thought it was just "part" of a "dream" I was having as  I watched the bedroom window push open from the outside and a  wom- an, one of my own guardswomen, climb down inside the room, cling- ing to a rope she had used to descend from the palace roof above."Tori!"  I breathed softly, watching the woman,  her  helmet and  chain mail gleaming there in the moonlight as she  drew  her dagger,  the polished steel blade gleaming, the weapon  the  long slim blade often carried by Warrioresses for close quarter work.I could tell after the first few seconds that the woman  was not my equal in skill, although her armor did give her  something of an advantage here against me, one that she might "exploit"  if the "opportunity" presented itself to her.  She attempted to push me back against my bed, hoping to "trap" me, but I was too  quick for her, wheeling away, the sound of "pounding" against the  door leaving no "doubt" that my screams for help had been heard now..."Lucky she's got big boobs," Lorraine breathed, adding  that the dagger had not penetrated as deeply as it would have done had Tori not been a full breasted woman.  Tori, barely conscious now, trying a feeble grin as I took her hand, held it in mine,  hoping that she would live, that Lys would not take her now from me..."Won't get anything out of `her'," Darlanis said, the  woman having died of a broken neck from the fall.  I had already deter- mined  that she was not a member of the Royal Guard, but  just  a woman who had dressed in the uniform of one, fooling the  others.Dularn," Darlanis ventured, regarding me as I stood there now.  I had  ordered the body brought inside, a couple of my  guardswomen having  stripped it in their search for anything that might  lead to finding out "who" she was.  "Why" she'd been sent to kill me?"I never realized until now how much she meant to me," Diane said softly, looking down at her father sitting there beside  the still sleeping figure of Tori.  "How much I've `hurt' her by  all the things that I've done," the girl added, her eyes wet now with tears as she stood here in the uniform of a Dularnian midshipman."You said that when you first saw the assassin you  believed that  it  was just another one of your `nightmares'  you've  been having?" Lorraine said to me, her dark eyes glowing into mine  as we ate breakfast together, all us Queens along with Darlanis her- self tall and golden, looking truly the "part" of "what" she is."You once said that everyone living in this time, with the excep- tion of you and Sharon, has been `mind programmed' by the Priest- esses of Lys," I added, aware that this was "something" I'd  bet- ter  be careful to see never got to any ears that  it  shouldn't."And  it is `possible' from what Darlanis found below  Triskelion that Princess Tara could have had a machine capable of  producing electronic hypnosis left over from the time of Janet Rogers if we consider  the fact that we found the last remains of Domino  Tre- maine in that same spot, the woman who was Earth's last ruler.""I  would  certainly `know' that such a device was  used  on me,"  I pointed out.  I had no idea of what such a  device  would look like, but I expected it would have to be something that  was placed around my head or something I had to look into,  recalling how Lorraine had instructed me in the art of hypnosis one time..."However, it is a proven `fact' from what I have determined  that the  Priestesses of Lys do possess the technology  of  electronic hypnosis, the `existence' of which I determined for myself when I found  it quite impossible to hypnotize anyone of this era.   And the fact that I could not hypnotize Carol Simmons there last year is only a further proof that the Priestesses of Lys have been ac- tually tampering with the minds of people not even of this era.""You are building up a large amount of `conjecture' on  very little concrete evidence," Darlanis now smiled.  "And I refuse to believe that any Priestess would ever have anything to `do'  with an evil woman like Princess Tara," the Imperial Empress smiled..."I  think you should realize that even back in her own time  Lor- raine could only effectively hypnotize about half the people  she met in the course of her `practice', and it is quite likely  that Carol Simmons would not have been one of them."  I supposed  that it was true, as I had done a little "reading" of my own on  this.Lorraine going on to say that she and Bob once had a long  "talk" about such matters when I had allowed the "use" of the iron  clad steam  powered battleship Diana against the Empire of  Mexico  in the war between the two rival empires last year.  "In my  opinion for  what it's worth here the Priestesses of Lys may prove to  be just as `oppressive' as the Lorr were when they controlled us..."I smiled back, the hustle and bustle of the busy city almost  un- noticed just then.  The carriage we were using being one of mine, an  "escort" of the Royal Guard surrounding us, news of  the  at- tempted assassination having reached the people of the city now."You honor us with your presence," the Priestess said to me, giving Lorraine a smile as she stood there just behind me now.  A sense of "peace", of a lifting of a "burden" from one's soul  now going through me as I looked about the great Temple of Arsana.  A few people there in the pews, quietly praying to Lys for her help in whatever "problem" they might now be facing.  The great golden ankh there before us, brightly lit by candles, gleaming brightly.What I want to know here is if someone besides you people now has a device to induce a state of hypnosis and if such a `device' has been used on the Queen of Dularn to cause her to have  nightmares almost every night."  The thought going through my mind just then that if the Priestesses of Lys "were" as Lorraine said, then they would have considerable reason to wish Lorraine out of the way..."The Prince of the Wyomings arrives this afternoon," I said, keeping my voice "level" so that Lorraine would not "guess" how I felt about him.  The erotic thoughts that left no doubts about my own feelings towards him.  If Paul "wanted" me, I would be "his"."Maris is `sensitive' to things few are, and you have within you a `power' that I hope will be adequate to `deal' with what we will face," Tais answered, standing there, a rumble of thunder in the air now as the sun disappeared behind dark boiling clouds  of a  kind I'd never seen before except when a "GATEWAY"  was  being opened  to link together two separate parts of world space  time."Something  `spooky' about this place now," Darlanis  spoke, her hand on the beautiful ornate golden hilt of her slim sword as we walked through the now abandoned Royal Palace of Dularn to de- scend the rough stone stairs into the dark pits beneath.  I  felt only "terror", the sort of "terror" that can make a woman  "void" without even knowing that she is doing so.  Tais now holding  her ankh in one hand, and a silvery weapon of some sort in the other."A Warrioress may know fear, but she does not let it conquer her," Darlanis spoke, saying one of the famous "code sayings"  we have.  "Her `companion' is not a man, but a keen steel blade."  I drew mine then, the feel of the hilt comforting just then  too..."Smells,"  Darlanis muttered, the odor of sulfur  and  brim- stone  reminding  me of the odor of gunpowder.  The odor  of  the smoke released from Darl Jord's weapon when he tried to kill Lor- raine back three years before.  "`Something' moving in the  shad- ows too," the Empress spoke, her voice as level as if she'd  just said that it was going to rain!  I could see it rather clearly, a thing of "horror", of rotted flesh, exposed bone, glowing eyes...I'd  been in "need" of being "held", of having someone say to  me that they loved me, that I was an attractive woman, that I was  a Queen "worthy" of her crown.  Darl having unfavorably compared me to any number of his sluttish slave girls, all, he  "maintained", being a lot more "woman" than me!  I'm not too "proud" of what  I did back then, but I think you can see "why" I did it just then.I could see that.  The "effect" was much as if I'd been  "poured" into it like some candle into a mold.  I wore my briefest  silken strap, a wisp that would show under nothing, and my smallest  and most  provocative set of "clips" fitted over my pierced  nipples."You  `move'  beautifully," he said, kneeling there  on  the carpet, watching my every movement.  I then picked up the  bottle of  whiskey there on the table nearby and took a drink,  felt  it "burn" my throat, my green eyes burning "hot" into his.  I didn't feel very much like a "Queen" just then.  I felt "desire", a  hot burning "lust" that I knew would force me to "submit" to it!  The fact  that  such a MAN might kneel before me leaving  no  doubts."There will be a `tell tale' odor," I said, wringing out the washcloth  and holding it ready while he took a drink out of  the bottle of whiskey.  The last contractions of my orgasm now  dying away.  The leather strap tight against me, put on by his hands..."I've  heard of such things, but I never beli
