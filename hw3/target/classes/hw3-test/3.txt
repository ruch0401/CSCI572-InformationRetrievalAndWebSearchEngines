5722018301	Kevin, take a look at today's (Saturday's) emerging conservative blogosphere meme (at least Volokh and Instapundit) - they're essentially passing on as fact the possibility that impeached federal judge Alcee Hastings could become chair of the Intelligence Committee in a Democratic House.I'm extremely dubious that would happen.  The Washington Post article that Volokh links, which reports on potential minority committee chairs under the Democrats, indicates that some chairs are sure things (Rangel at Ways and Means, for example) but that Hastings is far from sure.Kevin makes a mature and accurate point on Cleland.  Why do democrats continuously whine when their supposed heros are attacked on policy?  As Kevin said, what did Cleland's amputee status have to do with the attack ad?However, Kevin then goes back into his liberal cacoon and makes the silly argument with Lynch that the Republican ad somehow does the work of al qaeda and is a recruitment video.  Who is being recruited in Ohio with that video?  How is al qaeda being supported by a ad saying vote republican so we can kill al qaeda terrorists because they are monsters.One last thought that does not penetrate the liberal cacoon. Los Angeles, that's in a territory called Alta California or something, right? Wasn't there some controversy about the US acquiring it from New Spain? Has this Alta California place applied for statehood yet?  Israel's actions are naked power politics dressed up as moral rectitude.  Isn't arguing that we cannot win militarily in Iraq or we need to redeploy out of Iraq doing the bidding of al qaeda?  Kevin will not acknowlege that, but he strenously argues that a political ad that we need to be tough on al queada somehow supports al qaeda.  His ship returned to its Long Beach, Calif., port on June 6, 1968, the day that Robert F. Kennedy died from a gunshot wound he received on the previous night at a Los Angeles hotel. Yes, it intends to influence american politics, but not the way al qaeda wants to influence politics - it seeks to elect republicans not democrats.  It is amazing liberals don't see that, but I guess they cannot accept that al qaeda wants democrats to be elected.One cannot help but notice that the liberals are screaming and confused again and you have the masterful tactics of George W Bush to thank for that. What looked like a "slam dunk" for the liberals last week is now, at least according to Barron's, not going to happen. I don't know why someone would purposely hand them bad information, unless Rove is cooperating, so that they can keep Cheney from playing power politics to shut him up until Rove give Fitz what he needs. No, sorry, liberals--you played the expectations game and you lost. Of course, really gifted teachers can make any method work, and will develop eclectic strategies tailored to each individual.  But only an idiot would prescribe a curriculum based on the teachers being exceptionally gifted, just as only an idiot would design a word processing program that only worked for people with computer science degrees.You young folk may be familiar with the book title, Why Johnny Can't Read.  You built yourselves up as winning seventy seats and now you'll be lucky to win twelve. The American people have sussed you out--you're prepared to surrender to all of our enemies to have the privilege of raising taxes on everyone who makes more than $12,000 a year.This video does not look like a Jihadi recruiting video--it looks like an honest assessment of the situation. If the Dumbocrats take over the Congress, we will start capitulation talks with al Qaeda. Osama will get to come to Washington DC and stay at one of the finer hotels while he is fawned over and primped with new clothes from the Men's Warehouse, all courtesy Screaming Dean's credit card.Did it ever occur to you liberals that the video looks the way it does because the GOP is going to try to enlist Arabs in a jihad of their own against Osama? If you can't beat'em, trick them into fighting each other, as the saying goes.My dear fellow, that's a good question that should be answered honestly. Because I don't think we're going to get anything approaching an honest answer, you should step aside and let me take the reins on this discussion as I have far more credibility and experience as a Republican on this blog.In the first place, this country has millions of crater-faced, good-for-nothing liberal kids who sit in their dorms and watch that Stephen Stewart fellow make lame jokes on the Comedy Central pay channel. They hoot and holler and play video games and grabass and use drugs at an astonishing rate while they snicker helplessly at a good man fighting a good war--one would think that these cretins would receive a severe beating in another period of our history for even thinking they could laugh at a joke about the Secretary of Defense. If the people running the show really believe we can attack Iran or Syria and not face apocalyptic consequences (and whatever eschaton the neoconservatives may immanentize, to use Voegelin's phrase, it's not the "Left Behind" one), then we're beyond any kind of normal democratic dialogue and into the realm of pure power politics. So you have idle kids and disposable income--now you expose them to liberalism. It's like nitro-glycerine and dynamite wrapped in semtex and set off with a potatomasher handgrenade. Suddenly, you have kids on drugs with nice cars committing jihad in our heartland, all for the privilege of being able to high five one another as the Federal Courthouse in Columbus burns to the ground with thousands of good people inside.In an interview with Al-Jazeera television aired late Saturday, Alberto Fernandez, director of public diplomacy in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department offered an unusually candid assessment of America's war in Iraq.Stand down, man! You are incorrect and misguided! Tax cuts have made this nation strong, secure and vibrant! They are driving an economy shaped like a freight train through a train yard full of derelict cars like a knife through hot butter! We are kicking ass everywhere and writing down the names when it pleases us. Did you miss the part where the Dow closed at its highest level ever? Did you miss the fact that gas is under $2 a gallon in some places?That was a leer, you maniacal hussy. Why don't you hop on your motor scooter and hand out tickets to a Dumbocrat pity-party on November the 8th--I hear they're serving wine, cheese and a healthy plate of hush the hell up.What we need here is an honest discussion of whether al qaeda wants republicans to lose and democrats to win.  It seems obvious to me that they would, but perhaps some here have a different view.  If it it true that they want republicans to lose, then the republicans' use of al qaeda tape to defeat democrats is obviously not doing the bidding of al qaeda.Some people can snicker and sneer about doves and beatniks and liberals until the cows come home; they can huddle in their houses with central heating and running water, watching Fox and yapping on about national security and terrorism whle munching Fritos; they can pontificate about evil liberal morals - but their own privacy and rights are, of course, of paramount importance.No one can stand a hypocrite, and that, unfortunately, is this administration through and through; that is exactly why we have few diplomatic cards left to play.  But it is not what I understand America to be; fearful isolation is not what I was taught our forefathers envisioned for this country.I am PROUD to be a liberal; I am proud to work for peaceful causes; I am proud to be a Democrat, and I'm proud to be the daughter and granddaughter of veterans.  And I am, as I'm sure other liberals are, so over apologizing for my beliefs.  It sure wasn't our policies that got us into this quagmire.Willful ignorance and blind hypocrisy, however, just piss me off - yes, this peace-loving hippie-esque commie liberal is pretty fucking sick of being told I'm unpatriotic by some asshole who supports a war that could end my boyfriend's life at any moment.  Prattling about how "hawkish" one is - that's really not something to brag about.  But then again, what do I know?  I'm just a "crater-faced, good-for-nothing liberal".Yes, yes I do! I giggle and laugh helplessly when some liberal thinks they know what they're doing. One time, I had to throw away a perfectly good pair of boating shoes because I laughed so hard and ruined them. Beatniks? Beatniks? Dear lady, we cracked beatnik skulls in the middle part of the last century when my fraternity would travel into New York City for fun and hijinks. I, myself, cracked the last beatnik's skull with a beer bottle in 1964. And, if you live where there are cows, please--do not post here. This is for people who live in decent places, yes? There are plenty of blogs out there that will publish your latest sob story about how the milk cow fell over the pig and gave out bacon flavored dairy products.You liberals have taken every shot imagineable at me, and in moments you'll begin to see the ham-fisted parody posts appear--they are insignificant to me. I am powerful and I can destroy you liberals without breaking a sweat. I have been to war, as you all know.It isn't abandoning moral principles to see nothing wrong in exploiting the social conservatives lack of ethical standards, outside an obsequious deference to their own selfishness, crapulence and bullying, to be rid of them.Al Qaeda are terrorists who would want to cut the heads off of each of us and who were pleased to kill 3,000 innocents on September 11.  I don't think, and conservatives never argue, that democrats are interested terrorizing American people the same as Al Qaeda.  Can't we bring some sanity to this discussion?How do you figure?  They have seen great success under this president and this congress.  Their recruiting numbers are way up, they have killed more Americans than they did on September 11, and we went to them to make it easy for 'em.  So sure, they are just achin' for these clowns to be tossed out.Why, I can rely on the obstinacy and stupidity of boneheaded American hawks, goading them into land wars in Asia (when they really should just be sending special forces teams after me) turning a significant population of the Muslim world against them and recruiting them to my point of view.Like any revolutionary group, al Qaeda relies on press and the discontent of the locals to survive.  Without either they would just wither on the vine.  Republicans have given them an inexhaustible supply of both in spades.I realize you apparently sincerely beleive democrats would do a better job in the war on terror, but it is astonishing how you project your own Bush hatred/democrat talking points into the minds of Al Qaeda.What was unique about George Bush's reaction" was the additional choice to invade "not a country that had been engaging in anti-U.S. terrorism but one that had not been, Iraq." >In so doing, he estranged allies, enraged potential friends in the Arab and Islamic worlds, and produced "more terrorists than we jail or shoot."Richard Clarke -- not a Democrat, no Bush hatred, terrorism expert -- plainly sees what a disaster Bush's policy has been for the U.S. and what a windfall it has been for al Qaeda and terrorist groups everywhere.I realize you apparently sincerely believe Republicans would do a better job in the war on terror, but it is astonishing how you project your own liberal hatred/Republican talking points into the minds of Al Qaeda.If you really have an open mind, it is a fair question to ask for my arugment.  But when the argument is over the mental state of others who neither of us have ever met (in this case, Al Qaeda), it really is not a question in which each side is in a position to present much evidence.But as a matter of commons sense, any political defeat of a party that has attacked Al Qaeda has to be looked upon favorably by Al Qaeda.  Bush is their principal enemy/adversary.  If he goes down, they like it.When they brought down the conservative party in Spain, they rejoiced.  They no doubt would rejoice with a Blair defeat in Britain (even though conservatives likely would be more hostile to them than the labor party).I think I am in a pretty good position to interpret the middle eastern mindset in contrast with the western-rationalist mindset.  I have lived in the middle east for just under six of my 43 years.  So please, state your case.  I am qualified to make a judgenment.In case you missed it, the militants in Afghanistan fell back, regrouped and are now back.  Any feelings of glee they feel at the defeat of Bush will not be for the reasons you seem to think they will be for.  It won't be relief that he can't come get them now, because he isn't doing that anyway.  Where is Osama again?  Any happiness thay feel at neocon downfall will be one of "Ha! The bastards got theirs!"  And I can't deny them that one.The only hatred on display here, brian, is yours for the truth.  One doesn't have to hate the kids in the Special Olympics to recognize that they are not, in fact, capable of competing on a level playing field with regular Olympic athletes.  In the same way, Republicans are not competent on national security.  Those who want Americans to be frightened are pretty much guaranteed to be happy with an advertisement that scares the American public.  The terrorists can only be happy with this ad.Unless there's something missing from the audio on the GOP site, this is not an effective ad. The viewer is expected to read some pretty dense prose quickly off the screen while the tick-tock rises in volume annoyingly. It's a turn-off on several levels.I'm not sure it's the right question. First of all, they're not available. The National Guard brigades--you know, we just had Lieutenant General Blum testifying, we had the chief staff of the Army testifying. The Army is $23 billion short, our equipment's coming apart, we're drafting 42-year-old grandmothers to be privates in the Army. I shouldn't have said draft, asking for volunteers. So I don't think the combat power is there in the Army and the Marine Corps to solve this problem militarily.The notion that we can threaten them with conventional air attack is simply insane. First of all, we're more vulnerable than they are to having the Persian Gulf closed, to leaving 135,000 troops 400 kilometers up into Iraq with a Shia population on our supply lines. Never mind our allies who I think are terrified by this, the--you know, the notion that we would use air power to go after 70-some odd nuclear sites.The Iranians are going nuclear. It's going to change the region for the worse in the coming 10 years, and hopefully not provoke the proliferation of WMD, where you end up with an Arab Sunni bomb to counter the Persian Shia bomb. So I think the answer to this one is diplomatic, economic: build alliances, stop threatening military action.You know, one of the, one of the other problems that I think the administration is trying to face up to finally, certainly the National Security Council is, we drained $55 billion out of the U.S. Air Force and the Navy and we're putting that money into ammunition, medical care for wounded soldiers. We're, we're literally giving up our modernization program for the forces that need to be there in 10, 20 years to deter the People's Republic of China. We don't need the F-22 to confront the Iranian-Iraqi insurgents; we need that high- tech capability to make sure we maintain stability in the coming years.Alberto Fernandez , the top U.S. State Department diplomat to the middle east, speaking in Arabic in an interview with al Jazeera that aired Saturday afternoon, confirmed what we already knew when he said "We tried to do our best but I think there is much room for criticism because, undoubtedly, there was arrogance and there was stupidity from the United States in Iraq. We are open to dialogue because we all know that, at the end of the day, the solution to the hell and the killings in Iraq is linked to an effective Iraqi national reconciliation," he said, speaking in Arabic from Washington. "The Iraqi government is convinced of this." He went on to state that failure to pacify the widening sectarian strife in Iraq as well as an enduring insurgency would damage the entire Middle East. "We are witnessing failure in Iraq and that's not the failure of the United States alone but it is a disaster for the region. Failure in Iraq will be a failure for the United States but a disaster for the region."GC, what did you mean with the remark about the French origin of military ranks? I thought it was primarily the result of the Norman invasion and the mixed heritage of English, but I understand that your background may give you some extra insight.As I said, it's a short list, there are more. Try googling "Iraq Al Qaeda Recruiting" and begin sifting the results.  The neocons in the Republican party have been Al Qaeda's wet dream -- and vice versa.  Without a boogeyman to frighten Americans with, Republicans would not have been winnning elections as they have over the past three years.Before George Bush, there was a President aware of threats to the country by those whose hatred over what had been done in their own country overrode any consideration except retaliation : even though that guaranteed payback.I think most find it weird for someone to have a strong connection to the military - dad was at war - I took a few years of training - and Protestant with  some time pushing that for perhaps more than it deserved.The incompetence we've displayed in Afghanistan, a country in which we actually had a chance to make things better, should have warned everyone that this administration would make a mess of anything it attempted. Yet it was returned to office.If Republican leaders feel blindsided by the turn, then they would do well to pay a call to the Wheaton home of Lois and Gerald Sheridan, for years one of the GOP precinct committeemen who rallied voters for Hyde at election time.Fed up with the Bush administration and the Republican Congress, the Sheridans say they are backing Democrat Tammy Duckworth as Hyde's replacement over Republican Peter Roskam. They say a lot of their friends and neighbors will be doing the same.In the ongoing Iraq debate we're rehashing rhetoric from Vietnam. Talk of "appeasement" rehashes arguments from before WWII. With all due respect to Marx and Santayana, we're doomed to repeat history, as both tragedy and farce, for the same reasons we did it before, because we can and because we can be persuaded that we have to.Back to our host's main point: Clinton, who had actual issues which could be exploited and were, vigorously defended himself and won elections. Kerry and Cleland were viciously smeared by lies and lost.I'm rather disappointed that Brian failed to lay out his case.  I have been waiting for five years for someone to explain this all to me in such a way I could have a light-bulb moment and just give over to it all.  But always that liberally biased bitch reality rears its head.This is why al-Quada relishes Bush remaining in office.  In days of yore in Afghanistan, they only practiced fighting methods.  Today, under our very generous federal grant program of On The Job Training, they can actually train in the real world of combat.  Even though they lose many, it helps recruit more and more willing combatents.I'll tell you why not. Because it does nothing but induce fear. As long as people are basing their actions on fear they are using predominantly their reptilian brain and do not think logicaly. Thus they will not be open to hear a hopefully more rational solution from the democrats when it is presented to them and will be even more inclined to vote for the party of Big Brother. Unless the Dems are willing to out Big Brother the Repubs, and in this day and age that would mean becoming all out fascists, the only hope lies in lowering the level of fear and allowing people to act on thought and not emotion.Wow ... why would another perfectly sane and cordial liberal steal the handle of the notorious concern troll Will Allen?  I don't get that at all; the original Will rarely shows up to begin with; he hasn't been here since we spanked him hard for his Studds = Foley equivalence two weeks ago.  Weird ...Mehlman is trying very hard to put out the meme that the GOP has stablized in the wake of FoleyGate diminishing as a wall-to-wall mediathon.  Notice Rove's insane spin last week that the GOP has "$100 million" in the bank to spend in the home stretch, when their overall cash advantage is closer to $10 million and the Dems aren't hurting for money in the final stretch.  But recent polls are showing the Dems leading in only 10 of the 15 seats they'll need to take the House, and are still two away from the Senate.  Putting aside the public mood reflected in all the recent macro-level polling data, the election can be seen as much closer than some of the giddy expectations we've been hearing in the wake of the first week of FoleyGate, which stopped a GOP poll recovery after Terrorism September dead in its tracks.But notice something:  Much of the last weeks' "Democratic sweep" talk didn't come from Democrats.  It came from MSM GOP pundits.  Some of it, no doubt, reflects the anger that conservatives feel about Bush's incompetency -- but also I think at least some of it came as a deliberate attempt to jack up Democratic expections.  Certainly they're now attempting to use this meme as the foundation for their new one:  that a narrow win will mean that Democrats lost the expectations game.The alphabet used in French ( or Italian, i.e. Latin ) is the same as English. Usage for pronunciation : not. What I'm saying is that phoenetics ( or phonics these days) mislead compared to common use. Change languages and import a foreign word and it's as bad as trying to import foreign software and expecting it to run natively.My favorite part (in the section on DU) was that Michio Kaku is a CIA mole broadcasting on WBAI (part of the fake-leftist Pacifica radio network) who's pushing string theory (against honest ol' quantum mechanics) as part of a government disinformation campaign to keep the masses in the dark about "basic physics."You only thought Marxism was extreme. Korean juche makes Marxism look like Montessori. When this regime finally collapses, the world is going to have to deal with an entire nation with psychopathologies normally associated with the trauma of captivity.All they do is bash Bush.  If he acts multi-laterally, he should be unilateral.  If he's unilateral, he should be multilateral.  If he makes war, he should have negotiated.  If he doesn't make war, he should have attacked.Liberals have truth on their side - 9-11 happened on Bush' watch and when it did, he sat and stared blankly into space for over seven minutes, doing nothing because he has no ability to think on his feet, and then went and hid in a cornfield in Nebraska.  Some fucking hero.The upper ranks in the French army use the phrase"mes enfants" when referring to their troops. Sometimes you will hear "aux armes, mes enfants!" It's a holdover from far earlier times when officers in the French (British also) purchased their commission and the regular soldiers were improvised recruits or conscripts. I have never read that anyone considered that condescending, merely custom. In the Marseilles, the phrase is Allons enfants de la Patrie, which translated is [forward, arise, or let's go] "children of our country" and more in the tradition of referring to one's country as the Fatherland or the Motherland.True. The Bush team has only allowed one catastrophic terrorist attack.  Of course, that's one more than any other administration.  How can you be less effective than failing to secure Afghanistan, failing to capture/kill Bin Laden, and failing to win in Iraq?"Psychopathologies?"  Fuck you, Matt.  In fact, why don't you do a little looking in the mirror.  In all the time I've seen you post here, Matt -- I find it very difficult to recall you leaving a post that wasn't a vicious personal attack.  99% of the time it's directed at a troll, so you're safe from reprisal.  But do you, like, *ever* talk about issues?  Because if this is all about snarking at individuals for you, then you really shouldn't be throwing stones ...Oh bullshit, Matt.  I haven't posted very much at all this past week, and this weekend almost nothing.  I tend to read all the threads, but most of them I don't post in because I have nothing ... to ... say ... on that particular subject.  Like most of us, I have strong opinions on a few things and an aversion to repeating myself.  This is why I've hardly posted anything on the recent Iraq threads.  Others are covering the factual material, and I've made my opnion quite known.I do enjoy engaging a few trolls and quasi-trolls, because I like closely-reasoned point-by-point exchanges.  So sometimes a thread (usually well after it started to go stale) will become full of my back-and-forth in that sort of exchange.  But this is compensated for by the fact that for that time I'm not on any of the other threads.Yes, but the candidate attacked in the ad is a DEMOCRAT. And we all know that Islamofacistpornaddictcutandrundefeatocrats must be challenged at every opportunity. The ends justify the means...if we want to preserve America from the Islamic fundamentalist phone sex addicts, we have to point out that all Democrats have called phone sex lines, or have at least thought about it.Crozier recently tested his theory by doing what millions of students only wish they could do: fire round after round into a Calculus and science textbook with an assault rifle and handguns. Even better, he made a home video of his experiment and provided an unedited copy to a local Oklahoma City television station.Anyway, the phone records are probably a matter of public record; Meier was staying in a hotel on the taxpayer's dime. Quite rightly, his bill is available to the public. Doubtless, some intern desperate to justify his existance was tasked with going over the old records, made a moron of himself, and his superiors didn't do enough checking up on him.Although not quite as dispicable as the example given, the Ron Saxton, Pub for Guv, people ran an ad which said that Governor Kulongoski was allowing illegal immigrants to vote - The Secretary of State and the Governor have denied the charge.When Saxton's people were questioned by David Sarasohn of the Oregonian, they admitted they did not have evidence to back their charges. When asked why they ran the ads with no supporting evidence, they said they did not want to get into the "nuances" of the ad at this time.  They will probably discuss it in full on November 8.You can't have it both ways. It's only comparatively insignificant if it's the "obscure" Republican candidate who is responsible for the ad. But it's the National Republican Congressional Committee who is knowingly smearing the Democratic candidate. That's your stinking party, pal. And it's only a tiny example of their dishonesty -- just as your remark is a tiny example of yours.And there seems to be a misconception that I'm a republican; I'm registered as an independent. I'll probably vote for a few democrats in local races this November. I don't care about the outcome of the race in question; it's a backwater.The National Republican Congressional Committee, which this year dispatched a half-dozen operatives to comb through tax, court and other records looking for damaging information on Democratic candidates, plans to spend more than 90 percent of its $50 million-plus advertising budget on what officials described as negative ads.Democrats and their media allies are already complaining about the "unfair" tactics of Republicans and the election is some weeks away. In the good old days when the Democrats ruled this country because they were simply more popular and more in touch with the American people, we didn't hear much whining from them. (I sure didn't because I was a Democrat then.) How times have changed! The current Democrat motto is- "Everybody loves a whiner."Today's NY Times has a chart that outlines the "key communications" in the House of Representatives about Mark Foley's inappropriate contact with pages. More than one of the names in the chart, which includes Kirk Fordham, are rumored to be closeted gay Republicans who have been working at the highest levels of the Republican leadership.We can be confident that some Dem supporters are doing the investigations and outings.  The liberal LA Times is happy to cooperate in the outting.  O'Donnell is frank enough to crow about these (alleged) gays being outed, because he thinks that will discourage Evangelical from actively supporting Republicans.They're doing the same shit in Tennessee against Harold Ford, with the Republican candidate making the same phoney principled call for pulling the ad. But his hands are tied because the party just won't listen to him. Poor guy.I fail to see the significance.  Pointing out the hypocricy of the party that originally framed the debate for saying one thing and doing another?  Sorry, but you gotta do better than that before you lot get anywhere with me.Wes Boyd, president of the group's Voter Fund, said in a statement the ad was one of more than 1,500 submissions that were posted on the Web site www.bushin30seconds.org for the public to view and comment on."None of these was our ad, nor did their appearance constitute endorsement or sponsorship by MoveOn.org Voter Fund," he said. "They will not appear on TV. We do not support the sentiment expressed in the two Hitler submissions."For example, Republican Saxby Chambliss ran an ad against Sen. Max Cleland, a Georgia Democrat who lost three limbs serving in Vietnam, that used bin Laden's and Saddam's faces to criticize a Cleland vote on homeland security.By the way, unlike you guys, when our guys cross the line, we call them on it ourselves.  Care to try an argument that is not intellectually dishonest or based in flat-out false-hoods?  Take your time.Al, I would like you to prove this 'Godless' rant you guys are always on about. Seems to me the GOP has some 46 perverts, predators, and pedophiles, not to mention corruption..and you are going to tell me that GOD is on the side of these people?Democrats here in Washington are quite openly registering every warm body to vote under the "hate free zone" rubric. To these folks, raising the issue of citizenship at all is a hate tactic. Reminding the public that, in theory at least, it is against the law to vote if you are not a citizen is an act of hate.I saw this coming when I first started campaigning and decided that if you can't beat them, join them.  Many immigrants do have conservative views on a number of issues, especially our huge Slavic community. This reality is putting local liberals in a bit of a pickle as they are trying to figure out how to suppress Slavic non-citizens from voting while encouraging more malleable illegal immigrants to exercise that "right."Gregory wrote: Here's a clue, "ex-liberal": Deomcrats don't believe there's anything wrong with being gay. It's the Republicans that need to indulge in the hypocrisy of having prominent members in the closet.Copies of The List (see below) have been sent by gay politicos to a variety of social conservative groups that look to the Republican Party to make their religious right dreams come true. The recipients include the Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, the Alliance for Marriage, Concerned Women of America, the Eagle Forum, and the Southern Baptist Convention. Officials at most of these groups have had something to say about homosexuality and gay rights in the wake of the Mark Foley scandal.Keith G., yes there is still some discrimination against gays, and it's deplorable. But, I don't see the Republican Party discriminating like that.  On the contrary they chose as head of the Republican National Committee a gay man.  (More precisely, Ken Mehlman was outed by this group that seeks to out gay Republicans.  He has not specifically addressed his sexual orientation.)  He is openly Jewish.I can easily believe that there may be some Republicans in Texas who are bigoted against gays.  But, a party that selects a gay National Chairman cannot fairly be accused of systemic bigotry torward gays.There's a great movie called Colonel Redl, which is the the true story of a man who briefly became head of the Austro-Hungarian secret service just before WWI. He was Jewish and gay and everyone in a position to influence his career went ahead and got, or allowed, him to be promoted because every one of them figured they had something on him.He appoints them, just as he appoints everyone, for their willingness to dishonestly do or say anything it takes to advance the wealth and power of the wealthy and powerful, while oppressing the poor and powerless.The punchline, of course, will come when some scout creates a video public-service announcement tht includes pirated material from an after-school special about the dangers of piracy. The script almost writes itself.Pirating is stealing.  What's so wrong with giving merit badges to kids teaching others not to steal?  Do you support stealing?  Are you going to come out in support of murder next?  Since you support legalized abortions, that wouldn't surprise me.Kevin's line, 'the script almost writes itself' tells us nothing about the Boy Socuts, but something about Kevin's prejudices.  In his world, the Boy Scouts are bad, so he finds a way to turn an admirable focus on integrity into a hypothetical hypocrisy.What Al fails to mention, either because he is a corrupt troll, or because he is fairly dumb **, is that many people feel that there is no obligation to obey an unjust law.  Since many people think that the cuurrent state of copyrigt law is essentially an engine to oppress free speech, and transfer cash to the coffers of the powerful, they naturally treat copyright as a joke.I remember that Allen Klein who became the Beatles lawyer made his living prior to his contract with them by auditing record company royalty reports to see if artists were being shortchanged. He worked for a percentage of what he recovered for the artist. He pointed out that he never failed to make money on the deal.Remember the media industry makes its money from the distribution of what they consider product. The person who creates the real value seldom sees the kind of returns the distributor takes for granted.All morning there was this large herd of robins in our yard dashing around and chasing each other and having obviously a terrific time playing and swooping about. A squirrel was so inspired he took to dashing among the robins, who paid him no attention, and jumping up in the air and doing somersaults. This went on all morning in a rainstorm in the fog.This sucks, and totally vitiates the BSA's claim to be a force for the moral improvement of boys. To enlist in the fight against a sin so venal and insignificant, while holding one's tongue regarding far worse evils (as far as I know, there isn't a merit badge for opposing child labor), is to lack, and to be unable to impart, moral perspective.It is Saturday and I have a list of things to do a mile long.  But a rainy cold front is edging into our fair city and my two recently adopted kittens have realized that if they crawl into bed next to me and nuzzle and alternate between affection and napping, they get to keep me as an over stuffed pillow for as long as they like." Since many people think that the cuurrent state of copyrigt law is essentially an engine to oppress free speech, and transfer cash to the coffers of the powerful, they naturally treat copyright as a joke.While I agree that, as you say, the *"current"* state of copyright law is arguably not consistent with either the vision of the framers or with what most people would deem "fair" or "just," that doesn't mean that *any* misappropriation of intellectual property is defensible. Nor does it mean that anyone pressing such an argument is a righty troll.I make my living by selling a big chunk of intellectual property (that's taken me 15+ years of my life to create) to individuals who pay me a good piece of change to learn what I have to teach.  But I can't put it on the web because it would be Napsterized in a New York minute.  That means that hundreds, thousands, possibly tens of thousands of people who might benefit from the ability to access what I have to teach now cannot conveniently do so.  Or are you saying that having created it, I should now give it to anyone who wants it at no charge?For that matter, Scorpio, when it gets to the point -- not far distant, at the rate things are going -- where the grips and the makeup crew *are* being harmed by the pirating of movies, will you then agree that we have a problem? Or does the fact that many of the corporations that we're talking about here have a sordid history of stealing from artists and creators mean that the concept of IP rights has zero validity to anyone at all?These are not simple questions with black/white answers -- and it's unfortunate that it often seems that anyone who doesn't themselves depend on IP for their livelihood has a tough time recognizing that.It often seems much like that other situation -- how rightwingers such as, say, Bob Dole, only get that the market alone doesn't magically solve all problems for people such as, say, the differently-abled, and some gov't and regulatory intervention might actually be warranted and necessary, when they themselves are on the receiving end of a problem....  Huh.  Maybe we're not all that different after all.I notice the local scout leaders insist it was their idea and they didn't dream it up to get a big donation from the MPAA.  Anybody believe that?  Maybe the local LA scout leaders should remember that telling the truth is a value generally supported by their organization.What happened to the days when I was in boyscouts (8 years ago) when I had to go camping, learn how to tie knots, and build a fire without matches to earn a badge. Today, well, I guess boyscouts are going towards a more technological theme. Too bad.I suspect much of the piracy problem now encountered by the MPAA and others similarly benefitted by the current law is derived from the  fact that lobbyists and representatives tied directly to the MPAA wrote the current law without any regard to what might be the best balance for all concerned including the public. The current copyright law is, like the current bankruptcy law, another example of the serious shortage of responsible and fair minded legislators in Congress.I hardly see the problem in a one-sided complaint on the subject. There is nothing that the poster said that was wrong: the CURRENT state of copyright law (as opposed to some mystical nirvana somewhere) IS essentially an engine to oppress free speech, and transfer cash to the coffers of the powerful.Agreed, some provision for intellectual property must exist. Perhaps intellectual property rights should belong only to the intellectual who created them, and not to a parasitic collection of lawyers and accountants who grow bloated and fat off the creative labour of others, like the loathsome lampreys they are.So far, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., the national organization based in New York, isn't playing along with royalty demands. But the American Camping Association, in Martinsville, Ind., which includes many scout camps, advises members to comply. Diablo's regional Girl Scout Council in Oakland is low on cash and decided its 20 area camps can't afford the extra expense. Rather than risk a lawsuit, the council told camps to scratch copyrighted songs from their programs.Vincent Candilora, ASCAP's vice president and director of licensing, vaguely suggested that dark forces may have been behind a Wall Street Journal article last week that disclosed that the songwriters' group had sought this year for the first time in history to collect fees from children's summer camps.Candilora conceded that ASCAP had cast a wide and nondiscriminating net in notifying the nation's 8,000-odd summer camps that federal copyright law requires them to fork over fees to ASCAP for any songs they use.But he said Lo Frumento had been quoted out of context when he promised to "sue them if necessary" if they didn't pay for their campfire songs. And he was particularly insistent that ASCAP wasn't picking on the Girl Scouts, even though it has already collected fees from 16 Girl Scout camps this year. Any fees collected from the Scouts will be returned, he said.In the wake of news stories and editorials picturing ASCAP throttling tiny, hopeful renditions of "Puff the Magic Dragon," Candilora said the organization had been besieged with protests from both the public and its songwriter members.What's wrong with getting paid for your work? Sure, copyright law has been taken over by the corporations that finance artists, but what is everyone's problem with creators gettin' paid? I pay my cable company about $40 to hook me up to the web, there's got to be some way to spread the wealth around.Did you also see the Clinton/Spencer Senate debate?  "I'm the only one standing on this platform who wants to be a United States senator for New York for the next six years," said Spencer, a former Yonkers mayor, in his opening remarks.  Clinton acknowledged that she has thought about running for the presidency in 2008, but said she is committed to running for Senate re-election.All N. Korea wants is "a little respect". With any progress made by anyone else, stand by for GW to torpedo (already happening) any progress. He is a small minded combatist who would never actually fight for himself.What the NKors want is a two-party negotiation so that they can begin extracting new concessions from us. The six-party talks won't let them do that. Let's face it: should we ever agree to such two-party talks, the starting point will be us refusing to bend and the NKors demanding a list of things. Given the usual pressure to 'compromise', 'negotiate', and 'meet in the middle', where do you think that will end up?The six-party talks pushed by the Bush administration may also fail -- so far we haven't gotten much at all from it. The negotiations done by the Clinton administration and the Agreed Framework is also a failure (not Clinton's fault, he did the best he could with what he had at that time).If we really want the NKors to behave, we have to find the right leverage with China. China is the only one who will get the NKors to listen, and that happens only if China comes to see that the NKors are more of a threat than a useful tool.The Bush administration is still proceding under the theory that punishing and destabilizing (and hopefully collapsing) North Korea ought to be the object of its foreign policy rather than coddling it along like Clinton supposedly did. Meanwhile, the Chinese and South Koreans are freaking out that 1. there will be an new arms race, particularly if Japan feels threatened enough to start talking about going nuclear and 2. a tough sanctions regime might destabilize NK, producing an economic and humanitarian disaster of unimaginable proportions (not to mention suddenly leave an unknown amount of weapons-grade plutonium vulnerable to proliferation). So we're basically in the same situation as we are with all Bush foreign policy: writing tough-guy foreign policy checks our asses can't cash and then hoping somebody else will come in and pick up the tab.As I understand it, in the context of Chinese politics a national leader apologizing is a significant point. When you consider that Kim didn't actually do anything to China or kill a lot of people and that China was interested enough to push them, I think it may be their Theodore Roosevelt moment.So you think China should carry water for Bush? On what evidence would you base their concern for American interests? What North Korea wants is bi-lateral talks probably ending with a guarantee  for them of no attack by the US and/or South Korea. Any grown up administration would be willing to hold such talks; and there is no reason not to give such a guarantee. North Korea, like all totalitarian regimes eventually collapse, and the more open their contacts with the rest of the world and the less pressure from the US, the more quickly they will change.China has gained an enormous amount of face because Bush is afraid to deal with North Korea directly and is making China the region's superpower. If you think they're cracking the whip, you must find evidence, and there is none that China is taking any concrete steps to implement Bush's demands. By the way, Koreans and Chinese still hate Japanese for their conquest and occupation of the Korean peninsula and Manchuria. The Japanese were notoriously brutal.A friend of mine sent me an e-mail that said Kim could be a chess grandmaster with this 'compromise' move.  I wrote back and asked what he thought Bush's countermove would be.  He said, "Throw a checker!"  That sounds about right.The demand for a 'non-agression' pact isn't to protect themselves from a feared attack by an aggessive USA. It's to free their hands: once such a pact is signed they can engage in a number of activities knowing that the international community will hold the US back, based on its signature of the pact.What sort of activities: assassination of South Koreans. Counterfeiting of US currency. Running drugs on a large scale. Shipping missiles and perhaps nuclear components to other regimes. They've done it before. They want to do it again, and they want to do it free from fear that Uncle Sam would hammer them. Hence the demand for a 'non-aggression' pact.But North Korea is not East Germany. The people are different, they've been educated/trained/indoctrinated in juche for fifty years now, and their culture is radically different from what you and I can understand. 'Openness' simply isn't a concept there.Talking with North Korea does nothing except allow them to exert pressure on us for concessions on a world stage. The smart move is to say little to them, keep the sanctions in place, and find a way to persuade China to curb their job.Gregory: no one in the US can apply pressure to North Korea. Pres. Bush can't, and Pres. Clinton couldn't in his time. A new US president, whoever that might be, won't be able to pressure the North Koreans. Their position is such that they continue to go the way they are regardless of what we do short of military force (and we arne't going to do that).Likewise, neither Japan nor Russia can pressure North Korea to any signifiant extent. Japan just applied sanctions on travel and imports, and it won't matter very much at all. Diplomacy by these countries also hasn't worked.South Korea might apply pressure but won't; a friend of mine living in Seoul right now says that all the SKors want to do is enjoy their new-found first world lives. They have no interest at all in their crazy cousins to the north, and their method to keep the cousins at bay is to throw money at them. The South Koreans won't do a thing to upset the balance.The only country that can pressure North Korea is China. China is their patron and lifeline. China provides most of their energy, food aid, and new military equipment. China has (I've read) a good intel network inside North Korea. China has influence. China can strangle them quietly.But first they have to want to. Until recently the NKors have been a useful tool for China. They tie us down, they keep the Japanese humble and they push the SKors to move toward China. Nothing wrong with any of that if you're China. The nuke issue is troubling for China because it means Kim is trying to slip his leash. That's where we need to nudge the Chinese.That's utter BS.  I work with a couple dozen Koreans, and most all have relatives in NK and they all are interested in peaceful reunification.  Some of them even break the law supplying humanitarian aid to NK.Our enemies are ALL mad. Kill them. It's the only way. They hate us because they're nuts. Because they're nuts, the only discussion worth having is how we should kill them. You can't talk sense to madmen. Crazy people have no legitimate complaints. Kill them all. Fuckin' bug nutty psychos. Wipe them out.The only reason liberals are screaming for Bush to dump the other nations and go to bilateral talks is because Bush is doing the opposite.  If Bush were in bilateral talks, they'd be screaming about unilateralism."The only reason liberals are screaming for Bush to dump the other nations and go to bilateral talks is because Bush is doing the opposite. If Bush were in bilateral talks, they'd be screaming about unilateralism."Yes. It is a big difference. Let's put it this way: I spoke last year with a senior pro-market Vietnamese economist. He had met a bunch of North Korean officials on an NK state visit to Vietnam. And he clucked with pity at how ignorant and how far behind they were in their thinking; he thought it would take decades of reform and education before they could get up to the level that VIETNAM is at.What we want is the dismantling of NK nukeability; what China wants is ye old status quo ante - an illusion essentially, like this nonsense about Kim Jong supposedly feeling chastised will make everything ok. China is forced into this choice by its system and this demonstrates why, unless that system falls of changes substantially, China and the West are on a certain collision course. There's a lot of smoke being blown but the central fact is NK now has the bomb, we don't want them to have the bomb, the only country that can make that happen short of military option is China, China is locked into a reality that will not allow it to happen. Since Bush refuses bilateral talks, which would be the only way to remove China as a player and be the smart tactical move here, both sides will settle for the illusion of progress which will make certain a confrontation further down the road. Everyone knows NK has a nuke because China is allowing it to happen; China thinks they can contain the situation and avoid the unstable scenario they fear: but what if they can't and that bomb ends up somewhere it shouldn't be? China will be responsible for it. Then what? China is locked into actions which must lead to confrontation with west, the flash point are all there: Korea, Taiwan, Japan - it's an Asian powderkeg and, given the way things are playing out, it will blow just as surely as it's Balkan forebearer did.Baldric is going the correct path, but I am certain the Chinese are using NK to do what America did to Russia.  The Chinese learned alot from Reagan.  Make America divert its attention in two ways; away from the Middle East and spend money on the stupid Star Wars system.  China could take care of this problem rather rapidly if they so choose and since they do not, the powers that be must think it is in their best interest to use NK in this manner.The only answer is a strict trade embargo and a voluntary boycott of chinese goods already in the country.  I'm throwing out my toilet brush, shower curtain, bathmat, toilet seat cover, toothbrush, towels, shampoo, showerhead, heat lamp, and combs.  I'm keeping the toilet itself until I find an american replacement.  Tomorrow I'll start going through another room looking for "made in China" labels and I won't stop till it's all burning in the street.Sigh...that sounds considerably less promising. Does anyone see the Bush administration unilaterally lifting the sanctions they just imposed to get North Korea to return to even the six party talks? I don't.Lets say you're considered on your block to be mean, and probably unbalanced. all you've got to protect youself from all of these people are a lot of gaurd dogs that they are terrified of. You know everyone hates you, and you know they want you dead. (not a likely occurance in this country, but assume it for the sake of argument.Now, all of the sudden a giant of a man buys the lavish house at the end of your street. He promises everyone else on the street that he'll "deal" with you. He's always talking shit on you and you know theres going to be violence. Usually, his size wouldn't an issue, because you have all those dogs. But he has a high powered sniper rifle that can shoot you all the way down the street before you can send your dogs to attack the pretty japanese girl he likes that lives across from you. That's the only threat that's kept you safe all of this time. so you buy a gun. It's not as good gun, but it can shoot that pretty japanese girl, and there is no right and wrong in saving your own hide.Hole in the floor, with ceramic tile not only surrounding the hole, but with slightly raised areas on which to stand - And, of course, that handy dandy pull chain to the rear - Oh, that lovely whoosh sound. Hey, the French Army still uses them, those pussies they.Let me put it this way: like with the collapse of the iron curtain, when the current regime in the DPRK falls, it won't be the current officials who will be running the show, so what they do or do not understand is irrelevent.Yes, but SK wasn't, and look where they are now.  There is no reason to believe that the *people* of the DPRK will be substantially different with a little assistance.  They are not all the robotic drones that the Dear Leader wants you to believe that they are.Furthermore, you are underestimating how much of a basketcase the DDR was.  This is easy to do retrospectively if you had never visited the place (which I did) and since it all turned out relatively ok in the end.I had written: But North Korea is not East Germany. The people are different, they've been educated/trained/indoctrinated in juche for fifty years now, and their culture is radically different from what you and I can understand.Disputo writes further: There is no reason to believe that the *people* of the DPRK will be substantially different with a little assistance. They are not all the robotic drones that the Dear Leader wants you to believe that they are.Let's hope not. I've read accounts of NKor defectors who are utterly bewildered by life in South Korea; it takes them a long time to adjust. If by 'little assistance' you mean removal of the DPRK leadership and establishing a humane government, it would take a good generation at least for them to recover.The DDR wasn't first world (I also visited there prior to the fall of the wall), but it was not in nearly the bad shape the DPRK is in today. I'd like to think the SKors, Japan, and we would work to rebuild the North after Kimmie goes to his grave, but the challenge is substantially greater than what the DDR faced.Also, Dubya nailed it.  Has there EVER been a more pathetic bunch of "diplomats" in charge of our foreign policy?  And don't tell me Jimmy Carter.  The Chimperor just took him off the hook.  At least Carter had some humanitarian interests at heart.  The Chimperor is simply a puppet of the Neocons, and they're pointed headed academics who just found their pet ideas don't work in the real world.  Like good academics everywhere, they've found that to be very interesting, and they've gone back to their ivory towers to think some more.  Leaving the mess behind with no one to clean it up, and with the Chimperor playing over and over again the little record they left him. "Power of liberty. Stay the Course. God's gift of liberty. Democracy over Evil.  They want what we want."  Like wishing and hoping and stomping his feet and clapping even HARDER can make it work.I don't know and don't much care what Kim Jong said or didn't say (his "words" are not something any sane person would rely upon), but Kevin's post does show the power of the press in characterizing a story or even what someone says.  It happens everyday in matters large and small in our country, and it is a reason for reporters to be required to declare their voting record so the reader can factor that in when deciding the importance and credibility of a story.  The good reporters, regardless of their politics, will be trusted.  All reporters will play it straighter.  The biased reporters will be exposed and lose credibility.Amitava: I suppose they could be in theory, but you have to hand over your card to somebody, and that somebody is a union rep since they're the ones collecting them.  If Congress wanted to set up rules so that there was some neutral collection point, they could probably do that, though it would require funding of some kind.Which is a good thing because unions are a bad thing.  Unions take advantage of their members by stealing money from them through union dues while giving back nothing in return.  Unions hurt customers by giving them bad service while preventing the bad workers from being fired.Unions cause businesses to close down by forcing them to hire more workers at higher pay, but the business is worse off because the workers work less hours.  This causes businesses to close down causing higher unemployment.  Secret ballots are the best way to create unions because it will mean there are less unions and then workers will be better off without the corrupt unions.Unions are necessary to force big business to share the outrageous profits (ala WalMart) with the employees who actually make them on behalf of the company.  How criminally unconscionable that WalMart forces me to provide healthcare for their employees by forcing them onto the public dole.It seems that one way to AVOID the issue the Warren quote raises would be to eliminate the ambiguity about card checks -- which a move from secret ballots to card check elections would seem to entail.Here's one problem with both of these methods, which I have unfortunately experienced.  When Columbia University grad students held a secret ballot to get union representation a few years back, the university administration simply seized the ballot boxes and had them destroyed.  When we did a card count (a year and a half later or so), and had our majority certified by the attorney general and leaders in the state legislature, Columbia just ignored it, arguing in court that we grad students (who get paid by the university to do all the loathsome shit professors don't want to do, and for which the university doesn't want to pay them) don't do work since we are not workers but rather apprentices.  I really wish more bloggers out there had been following this and similar stories at the time (NYU's grad student union got busted earlier this year) because now all that organizing momentum has been lost.I'd also point out that coercive activity can be reduced if sufficient incentives are created to dissuade individuals and organizations from engagining in it. The fines for employers who violate labor law are paltry; if employers were paying $10 million per violation, plus losing the right to compete for public contracts, coercive behaviour would decline rapidly.Unions these days, from what I understand, have fairly good standards for card collection processes.  Card signings are witnessed by a second organizer, and the time and place of the card signings is written on the card.  These kinds of practices can steeply decrease the possibility of coersion.Still, NLRB elections would be reasonable if Congress added concrete measures to enforce them: say, a 30-day period between the day the election is declared and when the election is held (with a maximum of 90 days to allow for challenges), or something similar; and large punitive damages (in addition to back pay) to companies which participate in coercion.As I have noted at least once before, you continuously behave like an infant (and that is a bit of an insult to infants, but so be it).  The above comment is ample evidence of that.  In any case I will return to my normal practice of simply not reading your nasty but otherwise empty comments.The raison d'etre of labor unions is antagonism between management and labor. Go to any dinosaur facility dominated by labor bureaucrats - the NYC public transit system, GM/Ford, etc. - and any fair minded person will realize this is not the model for a productive enterprise or economy to follow. They served a useful purpose in the past, but it's time to take the training wheels off and develop other institutions to advance the policies/interests you want addressed.As to cards versus Diebold voting machines, of course I support Diebold.  Have you ever had a college classmate ask you to write a recommendation letter for him?  Ever felt a teensy bit of pressure to put something down you weren't comfortable with? Imagine a workplace where a clique of blowhards are running around demanding/requesting you sign their cards in front of them, and tell me which is more coercive.Yeah...when asked about how they could justify working closely with such an secretive and tyrannical system, which persists in denying the most basic of rights to the people they oppress, the leader of China said "Oh, I don't know, WalMart really isn't that bad."Local union officials visit workers at a 'target' worksite, and hand out voting cards.  Once collected, they present them to the NLRB for qualification.  If the worksite qualifies (high enough percentage of 'yes' cards), then its the NLRB that holds the secret ballot.I'm genuinely confused here. How are secret, government-board-reivewed ballots (the standard process for any election) where neither side (union or company) can see how each individual votes... why is this considered more open to manipulation or intimidation? And really, why are secret ballots being considered a bad thing now? That's always been a safeguard of the democratic process.My dad went to work for the New York Central Railroad in 1925 as a Railway Clerk,  He was 16, had to drop out of high school because his dad had just died and there were four younger brothers. He was the eldest of those still at home.He always said that the card check thing was the strength, but that he and his fellow clerks had always seen the card check as an opportunity to express strength on their own.  They got the cards in their possession; carried them with themselves all the time, (or kept them in their lockers), signed, but not yet turned in to the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks.Makes me nostalgic for the days when independent thinkers had the moxie to recognize that they had power in the mere threat of organizing, and used it for as long as it was useful, without actually jumping into the union certification process--which eventually meant paying dues and having to be under union discipline.Al, shockingly, does a very good job of identifying some of the very real problems with Organized Labour Unions. I know this, because I am a shop steward for the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, and I have seen all of this (and more) happen.But as usual, Al views the situation through the warped lenses of his Corporate Capitalist goggles, and fails to see that even though unions can cause all these problems, and more besides, they are still preferable for workers. Why, you ask?  Simply because typical management and business owners are too stupid, selfish, and short-sighted to simply treat their workers decently and pay them fairly.Unions do not sucessfully organize in companies where workers are well-treated. Workers are not stupid, they don't want the expense and problems of unionization unless they are already being mistreated.Which is a good thing because unions are a bad thing. Unions take advantage of their members by stealing money from them through union dues while giving back nothing in return. Unions hurt customers by giving them bad service while preventing the bad workers from being fired.A couple of commenters have hinted at this, but I'd like to ask directly: Isn't there a difference between "coercion" during a secret ballot where it's unlikely that the coercing party will every know how you've voted, and coercion that is ongoing and enforceable because one's decision to sign or not to sign is (presumably) known to both management and labor? It would seem elementary to me that the two forms of coercion are very different, and to say that management coercion in the former is much higher than labor coercion in the latter is, well, not at all indicative of which method produces results more reflective of employee sentiment. Furthermore, why give only the level of management coercion for the former and union coercion for the latter? I would think that both forms of coercion would be relevant for both methods of voting.Absent some reasonable explanation for why these forms of coercion are not different by their very nature, I'm convinced that Kevin's concern re methodology is more driven by results than any interest in fairness.But it's very easy to devise one that doesn't involve every worker going on record in front of the pro-unionizing folks as either pro- or anti-union. If there's something intimidating about one "election day," hold it over the course of a month. Let every worker pick a numbered ticket out of a bowl, provide a secure slotted box in which the tickets, marked "yea" or "nay," can be deposited, wait a month, and count 'em, making sure that there are not duplicate numbers or any other signs of forgery. The number of tickets issued is a fair upper bound on the number of valid votes.Last year the NLRB found that more then 15,000 workers faced initimidation employers for their pro-union activities.  Unfortunately, the NLRA does not have any effective remedies to prevent employers from intimidating their employers during secret ballot elections.  This is becuase the penalties for intimidation are minimal (Employers don't even have to pay fines if they fire pro-union workers).  Furthermore,  employers will often appeal cases where they are founding guilty of intimidation, this means that workers who are fired for their union activity can be unemployed for several years.One example of how the NLRB secret ballot election process back fires on workers is the case of Smithfield Packing.  Where the employer built jail cells on its property and locked up the pro-union employees other than those that they simply didn't fire.  Smithfield packing was found guilty of intimidation but appealed the case.  Smithfield packing also put pro-union employers in job classifications with the highest rate of injury and stripped the facility of all but the bare minimum of safety equipment, resulting in much higher rates of injury for pro-union workers.The NLRB found Smithfield Packing guilty of initimidation but the company appealed and the case dragged on for five years.  After the case was finally settled most of the pro-union employees had simply left the company or had been fired and the union had given up on organizing the packing plant.Another example of the failure of secret ballot election is the case of the Santa Fe casino in Las Vegas.  In this case the employees voted for the union through a secret ballot election.  The employer didn't recognize the union and appealed the election.  This appeals dragged on for several years.  Eventually, the employer exhausted its appeals and judge forced to recognize the union.  However, still the employer refused to bargain with the union in good faith.  The union sued the employer for bargaining in bad faith and after several more years had passed while the employer again exhausted its appeals a judge ruled in favor of the union.  Then instead of bargaining with the union, the employer merged with another company and fired 51% of the workers in the casino.  As a result the employer withdrew its recognition of the union, and tried to force another election.  During this period the employer also engaged in a variety of other anti-union activities such as interogating and firing pro-union employees.  A private security guard company hired by the casino company was even found guilty of attacking pro-union employees of the company as they left union meetings.When I was in college I used work as a dietary aid  in a nursing home in Pittsburgh.  When a group of employees at my hospital contacted SEIU to try to join the union, management interrogated most of the employees in my department one-on-one to find who the pro-union employees were.  Many of the pro-union employees then had their hours cut or were given less favorable shifts.  A few of people who originally contacted the union were simply fired.  This created a lot fear in the workplace, becuase many of my co-workers who otherwise supportive of the union were concerned about losing their job or their full-time status.  I certainly couldn't afford to lose my job, which was helping me to support myself while in school.  As a result the union drive fizzled out.  As far as I know, my co-workers who lost their jobs or had their hours cut were never compensated for their loses.   This is just my experience with the union election process.Yancey Ward wrote: As I have noted at least once before, you continuously behave like an infant (and that is a bit of an insult to infants, but so be it). The above comment is ample evidence of that. In any case I will return to my normal practice of simply not reading your nasty but otherwise empty comments.I'm fine with you calling me an infant...it's always amusing to see someone so smug in his superiority reduced to name-calling when unable refute arguments against his positions (or calling them "empty comment" to avoid addressing them).We can conclude that you're a liar, Yancey.  Rest assured that "empty" or "nasty" as it may be. I won't hesitate to remind the forums of your dishonesty (as I said before, if you don't like being called dishonest, you could try honesty, but evidently you choose not to, so too bad).Comparing card check and secret ballot elections that have occured in the US is not a reasonable way of determining which certification method is more prone to coersion, since the only way to get a card check in the US is to have the employer agree to it.  But if the employer agrees to card check, the employer is basically saying it doesn't mind a union (otherwise the employer would insist on a secret ballot).  So why should these employers who agree to card checks then turn around and coerse workers?  Or why should unions who already got an employer who isn't resisting unionization employ a lot of coersion?I am not sure if this completely answers your question, but in most cases employers only agree to card-check after an extended union organizing and pressure campaign where workers face a lot of employer intimidation.  Good examples of this are the Beverly Nursing Home case in Pennsylvania or the Yale Medical Center case.  Unions want to avoid the intimidation that takes place during this phase of card-check campaigns by changing the law so that employers have to recognize the union once a majority of workers are signed up on cards.My point was that in general it is very likely that card check certification, once it gets to card check, is less likely to be as contested as secret ballot certification, and that lower levels of coersion from both employer and fellow workers are to be expected in less contested certifications.  Firms that are aggressively anti-union and coerse unions do not consent to card check.Critics of organizing through card-check are concerned with initimdation on the part of pro-union workers and union staff, not intimidation on the part of management.  Therefore, when talking about organizing through card-check I assume Kevin Drum is refering to intimidation originating from the union and its supporters rather than management.  I hope this clears things up.  I am actually suppossed to be working right now.  So I can't really put to much time into thinking through these points thoroughly.But, sir, thanks for nicely in your Orwellian way confirming the Democrats as Fascist motif of yours; make sure to bring your best bat to the next union meeting to help your colleagues beat to the point of maiming anyone who thinks that a union at some particular site might not be particularly in their best interest.  Oh, and good luck with the same idea for political elections; then you can beat Republicans instead of just keying their bumperstickered cars or deflating the tires in the electioneering vans; I guess just hope your opponents don't to decide to refrain from using their more vast economic resources to bring guns should your non-secret national ballots  win the day as you would have the union membership ballots win the day.PS  Admitted arrogance here admitted, but, tsssss . . . You know, if you were capable of skilled agitprop, it might be different; but this is hack-work; you should apologize - not to me, but to those for whom you seek to advocate.When we did a card count (a year and a half later or so), and had our majority certified by the attorney general and leaders in the state legislature, Columbia just ignored it, arguing in court that we grad students (who get paid by the university to do all the loathsome shit professors don't want to do, and for which the university doesn't want to pay them) don't do work since we are not workers but rather apprentices.Speaking as a grad student, I agree with the Columbia administration here.  Personally, I think it's ridiculous that someone being paid to get a PhD is in the same category as, say, a factory worker.  However, I'm a science grad student, and our perspective tends to be completely different.I was an undergrad/employee at Yale from 1998-2003, during which time the graduate union (GESO) was constantly harassing students in the sciences for support.  These tactics included visits at home, inviting recalcitrant students for coffee and double-teaming them with GESO members, bothering them in lab, and generally refusing to take "no" for an answer.  This was going on for years, and there were repeated instances of students signing union cards just to get the GESO reps to fuck off.  GESO's consistent position was that a card count should be the standard for union recognition; had the university agreed to this, there would have been near-constant harassment of objecting students.By the time  I left, the union had pissed off so many people that a counter-organization had started, and grad students down the hall from me - on their own initiative - started posting anti-union signs and encouraging other students to vote "no" in a staged "election" put on for show.  The union proposal was defeated solidly; this was a nonbinding election that the university administration ignored and didn't bother to campaign against.  Afterwards, GESO switched to trying to unionize only the humanities and social sciences, and referred to the hard sciences as a "separate bargaining unit."I'm a grad student at Berkeley now, where there's been a union for years.  Union membership among science students appears to be minimal; it's widely regarded as a joke, especially thanks to some bizarre behavior by a union rep several years ago.  I certainly wouldn't claim that this type of coercion is typical of all unions, and my experiences are about as far as possible from the working class, but as far as potential for coercion is concerned, I'm skeptical that a card-count is any fairer than an election.Nat - A science grad student will spend roughly five years in a PhD program whereas a social science grad student will spend eight.  Science grad students get paid to conduct research, history grad students get paid to teach section and grade exams.  During the job search both types of grad students will be judged on the quality and quanity of their research.  Yet, only the science grad students are focused solely on their research.  If my only obligation was to research and write my dissertation I would agree with you about unions.  However, I spend a good twenty hours a week preparing for and teaching section, grading papers and meeting with students in office hours.  In at least some capacity I am an employee of the university.However, these "Science grad students" sound like they're generally doing the bidding of their employers and oversee no one.  If it wasn't for the fact that they were in an education program and don't pay a FICA tax, I'd guess they qualified for a union.  As it stands, what are the union going to do anyway?  Negotiate their homework assignments?That that study "turned out" very nicely, didn't it? Sponsored by some left-wing group and conducted by two professors. And who could ever guess what political leanings these profs have? I refuse to believe you're THAT gullible, Drummer. Please.Imagine if some non-party to the election (lets say, a foreign government, the FBI, or what have you) had the power to take voters into a room and threaten them with losing their job if they campaigned for their candidate, accepted the candidate's literature or attended the candidate's meetings?And if you would feel more comfortable knowing that ultimately a secret process occurs that helps ensure a true test of employees' preferences, bring in the American Arbitration Association or some other independent agency, and have them supervise a confidential "card signing" ceremony.The above examples of employer coercion during union organizing, even if accurate, do not warrant replacing secret ballot elections with card checks.  They just warrant strengthening penalties for unfair labor practices.  There have been egregious violations of voter rights in political elections of late, but I haven't heard any demands from victims that we throw out secret ballot elections.  They just want their rights enforced against those who try to deny them a vote.Is there a period of time that workers have to sign cardcheck? Because generally I think it's better but if say people can sign cards and like two years later the union gets enough that seems problematic.A coerced representation card is worse than useless to a union organizer. In an organizing campaign, the organizer rates each of the members by level of commitment. Weak and moderate supporters are counted with the non-supporters. Only the strong supporters are counted when deciding to present the cards for  an NLRB election or card-check representation. Organizer sent by the union know this, and look for real commitment before they ask someone to sign a card. However, most cards are given out by local workers on the organizing committee, and their efforts at persuasion may at times be perceived as coercion, and may in fact be coercion.Even though the NLRA only requires 30% to schedule an election, most unions won't go for an election unless they have cards for 65%. In a recognition campaign (card-check), you want cards for at least 75-80%.  The company management , seeing overwhelming support for the union, may decide that recognition may spare the expense and disruption of an election campaign, and will allow contract negotiation to start out on a less adversarial basis.For unions, coercion is an ineffective tactic. Coerced workers are likely to go to management and complain, which can tip off management to an organizing campaign in its early most vulnerable stage. Management can use such complaints to good effect in their anti-union efforts, and will likely cite such contacts in a complaint to the NLRB.Management, however, does find coercion an effective tactic. They have great levers: firing, threats of relocation, reassignment, reduction of hours, etc. The penalties for getting caught are so slight, they act with relative impunity. Forcing an election allows management 60 more days to apply these tactics, as well as ramping up the PR campaign.Does no one else see the irony when some of the same people who are outraged about congress throwing out historic protections such as habeas corpus for alleged terrorists then turn around and demand that congress throw out another historic protection, secret ballot elections for employees?Blix: maybe you should respond to posts as they are written, rather than to the ones unscrolling in your head. As I wrote, if we could ensure that the NLRB process was truly a "free and fair" expression of employees' will, there would be much less need - probably none at all - for card check.But I'll be interested to know exactly when the Chamber of Commerce, and other recent converts to the democratic principle of secret ballots would endorse such an agenda.  I think the phrase, "when hell freezes over," about captures it.Finally, don't conflate issues: there is no inconsistency between card check and a secret expression of employees' preferences.  If a union demonstrates a majority have signed up on cards, this can be easily tested through an independently conducted card check signing administered by the American Arbitration Association.The liberals who attack Wal-Mart today for the fact that its employees consistently vote against unions, were on the other side in the days when union membership was a pre-requisite for getting a job in a union shop. The freedom to work without belonging to an organization that collected the workers'union dues was not considered all that important. If Wal-Mart workers vote in a union, fine; if they don't, fine. But if the union succeeds it will be a big source of funds and support for the Democrat party. And that's what it's all about, all the talk about social justice to the contrary notwithstanding.I'd be delighted if employees of Wal-Mart and  companies of similar ilk were represented by unions.  But I'd hate to see that representation come at the cost of abandoning secret ballot elections in favor of card checks.  When the American Arbitration Association certifies card checks, they are only confirming that the names and signatures on the cards match those of employees in the bargaining unit, not that employees signed cards free of coercion.  Anyone who has actually been involved in card signings (I've been both a union member and a labor negotiator) knows that lots of signatures are the result of pressure from union staff and/or co-workers.The present system is not perfect, but it is built upon about 60 years of law and practical experience.  It preserves the most fundamental and important element of freedom in the form of the secret ballot election.  And yes, both sides (the union and the employer) get to campaign prior to the election and then the employees then get to decide in a secret ballot.  Unions win about half the time.  Only a naive or biased person would see this as a system that needs to be abolished.Although it is unlikely that congress will replace secret ballot elections with card checks nationally, in 2001 the Democrat-controlled legislature in California did just that for state government employees, who are not subject to the NLRA.  As a lifelong Democrat, I was embarrassed that members of my party caved in to union pressure on this issue.  Secret ballot elections are a precious right that should not be tossed aside for special interests.I do not necessarily want a union at Columbia, but I signed a card because union agitation over the last few years has improved the lot of the average grad student, forced the university to increase pay (which decreases time to degree, since fewer folks need second and third jobs, and likely ends up saving the university money in the end), provide better health coverage etc.In any case, my main point was similar to those being made by folks pointing at the minuteman brawl at Columbia a few weeks back.  Everyone was pretending to be surprised that a few students would rush a stage, and call into question someone else's right to free speech.  Yet none of these people, so far as I remember, made even the slightest peep when the university president Bollinger (a first amendment scholar) had our ballot boxes seized and destroyed.There's no set process - this is the result of bargaining between employer and the organizing union.  Some result in the AAA validating the cards organizers ask employees to sign.  Others result in the presentation of cards being followed by a AAA-run election.  Still others have the card signing take place under the eyes of AAA reps.The key thing is that the card-check process is preceded by an agreement between the employer and union on a free and fair process, in which the employer (at a minimum) gives the union a list of employees, ensures free access to the employees at work, free distribution of information, and promises not to retaliate or interfere, while the union promises to stop fighting the boss and pledges not to coerce employees.  Any process worth its salt includes a code of conduct, a means for complaints to be made and resolved, and a possibility for monitoring.The important point is that this takes place outside the framework of the NLRB and its provisions which overwhelmingly empower the employer and undermine the free expression of worker preferences, notwithstanding the use of a secret ballot.  A process run under such codes of conduct more closely follows any recognizably democratic procedure."Friend of Labor" doesn't seem to know much about labor history.  I don't have the time or energy to correct all the erroneous statements he/she has made about union organizing.  But I must at least comment on his/her unwarranted contempt for the National Labor Relations Act. We're told that it's a "pathetic process" that "overwhelmingly empowers the employer." If you're not old enough, like me, to have lived many years of NLRA history, at least take the time to read up on it. Pinkerton thugs were shooting unionists in the streets before this breakthrough law in 1935 that for the first time protected the rights of workers to organize.  The ranks of unions swelled by tens of millions in the years following its enactment.  It has served its purpose well for 71 years. The decline of union membership in recent years cannot be blamed on the NLRA.  If you don't like the politically-appointed NLRB members, elect a Democrat president to appoint liberal board members. If you think the NLRA's pre-election process can be improved, get out the vote to elect Democrats to congress and amend the law. Oh wait, that would take some actual effort, rather than just whining about how bad things are. With friends of labor like "Friend of Labor," who needs enemies?Whatever the merits of the NLRB in its day, and they were considerable, it has been turned inside out to be almost unrecognizable today. I seem to recall this story being used as justification for using the Predator drones, as a way of shortening the feedback loop between target acquisition and launch (hey, I have been watching the Bruce Willis movies!).  This is especially true as regards protecting union organizing.  The unfair labor practice provisions now offer about as much protection to workers during organizing drives as an unarmored Humvee does to our troops facing improvised explosives in Baghdad.  Any decent organizer or union-side labor lawyer could tell you this in a heartbeat.This started of course with the odious Taft-Hatley amendments passed the first chance a Republican congress had to start undoing the New Deal. That was the infamous "do nothing" Congress elected in 1946, which held the record for incompetence and right-wing zealotry until the current crop. Maybe Bruce Willis should be elected; he's good at stuff like that.   Have democrats been complicit in this - of course.By the way, I didn't say anything about the reasons for the decline of labor.  We can explore this theme in another thread when Kevin does us the honor of bringing it up.  There are certainly multiple reasons for decline, many of them self-inflicted, but it doesn't take a genius to understand that if you made organizing easier, cheaper, and less threatening to workers, there'd be alot more of it going on.  You yourself suggest this when you point out the obvious that passage of the Wagner Act led to the organizing of millions of new union members.  It stands to reason that its weakening - nay, its gutting - would at least contribute something to labor's decline.  There are perfectly good reasons to work hard to bolster organizing protections under the NLRA (as there are for reinforcing any other hard-earned rights).  That these strengthened rights would have the ancillary benefits of helping labor to grow make it an even more worthwhile endeavor.We don't need a lesson in civics from you: take it as an article of faith that I and lots of other friends of labor will be working hard to elect a President and Congress that will resotre the NLRA to its original purpose.  Really, really trust me on this: we are not just whining!  Again, thanks to Kevin for giving profile to the issue - which helps drive home to Democrats how important this discussion is.Interesting thread, especially the grad students pro and con.  I still think other institutions could provide all the benefits of unions with much less cost; the first would be a nationwide campaign to raise the minimum wage, which would cause a ratcheting effect on all wages.For those of you die-hard union groupies, I'll repeat an offer I've made previously -- I'll accept some of your pro-union rule changes if you require each union member to have an annual opt-out procedure [much like a 401(k) plan], full, plain english union budget accounting statement provided to the workers, and a limit on any union bureaucrat salary at $120,000 pay and perks. Any takers?Friend of Labor: What I've said about the NLRA applies to the Taft-Hartley Act.  If you don't like it, elect legislators to amend it.  I do not agree that it should be thrown out, anymore than I agree that secret ballot elections should be thrown out.  That's not being a friend of labor, that's being a stooge of labor.One result of the Taft-Hartley Act that I particularly have favored over the years is that there's been fewer strikes and more arbitration--usually by the American Arbitration Association that you so admire.  They've done a good job of resolving disputes peacefully and fairly.  Thankfully, the US has not had to endure the kind of paralyzing national strikes and violence in the streets that European countries routinely experience to this day.  Our labor laws, imperfect as they may be, have served us well.Arbitration is an empty reward when so few workers are united in unions. The number of workers who have access to your beloved arbitration has declined just as sharply as the number of workers who are members of an organization that gives us the power to launch a strike.Your defense of the NLRA is likewise unconvincing. The current NLRB process makes a mockery of the secret ballot by giving one side -- the employer -- the power to compel voters to listen to its arguments and threats in person while doing almost nothing to allow prounion workers to make their case. As unctuously as you and other antiunion folks rhapsodize about the glories of the NLRA, the NLRB is no nearly as vigorous as it once was in policing the process -- especially after Taft-Hartley.Finally, your pat dismissal of any criticsm of the limitations of the NLRA -- "elect different people if you don't like it" -- gets at the chicken and egg dilemma that working people face. Working people indeed do need to do more together to advocate for better policies, yet those deeply flawed policies create barriers to stop us from uniting together to organize an ongoing response to K Street.Albert Parsons puts his finger on it: "Working people indeed do need to do more together to advocate for better policies, yet those deeply flawed policies create barriers to stop us from uniting together to organize an ongoing response to K Street."Labor laws "were meant to serve workers," says Friend of Labor.  Well, that's a rather one-sided way of looking at law, as if it should favor some members of society at the expense of others.  In actuality, if one takes the time to read labor laws, it is clear that they are meant to serve all members of society.In the case of the NLRA, on the one hand it offers "protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively" and on the other hand it recognizes that such protections require the "elimination" of "certain practices by some labor organizations, their officers, and members" that "have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce."Blix: between your posing as a democrat and labor ally and your advocacy of a contemporary anti-labor position more in line with the Chamber of Commerce, you are tying yourself up in knots and mixing up your talking points.So now the NLRA - indeed all law - serves all members of society?  Laws are passed all the time that "favor some members of society at the expense of others" - have you spent any time reading the Bush tax code?"Pinkerton thugs were shooting unionists in the streets before this breakthrough law in 1935 that for the first time protected the rights of workers to organize. The ranks of unions swelled by tens of millions in the years following its enactment."It would have come as a great surprise to business in 1935 that the NLRA was meant to serve them; business vehemently opposed the NLRA and many employers refused to abide by it. It became a key theme in business' and the Republican Party's (unsuccessful) attacks on Roosevelt in the 1936 election.  Like the villains in the Bruce Willis movie "Die Hard" who pretended to be ideologically motivated terrorists, taking hostages and making political demands, but who were in reality crooks pretending to be terrorists to confuse and stall the cops and buy time to crack a safe and steal billions of dollars of boodle, Cheney and Bush and company are nothing more than crooks pretending to be conservative politicians in order to seize power and keep everyone confused while they plunder the nation's wealth for the personal profit of themselves, their cronies and their financial bankers.  They fully appreciated your insight about what would happen to their power with the enrolling of millions of new union members, and the first chance their party had in power, in 1947, they took steps to refashion the law in service of business interests.  No need to falsify history.Of course the NLRA did become what you describe (and in fact support) a legislative framework that has for many years reinforced social forces quite at variance with its original intent.  Again, we don't need the pretence here.If you have empirical evidence to contest the claims I made a while back about the way the NLRB currently operates to disadvantage workers, I'd love to hear them.  In other words, focus on the main issue here.  Otherwise go back to your HR job.I find it difficult to see how a case allowing the patenting of business methods would apply to tax strategies.  Any tax strategy necessarily must be based on the interpretation of a discrete set of materials: the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS's regulations, and court cases which themselves interpret the Code and regulations.  What's more, all of these sources are in the public domain.  In an ideal world, at least, there's little room for individual creativeness or judgment, unlike the situation with a business operating method that deals with an almost countless number of inputs.When, some years ago, biotech companies started having computer systems correlate proprietary and public databases to generate patent applications it became obvious that under current legal interpretation and regulation creativity, originality, and inventiveness have nothing to do with obtaining a patent.I dunno.  I don't think it is esepecially wrong of a corporation to take advantage of a tax loophole.  What I wonder is how do these companies that have obtained a patent on a business process involving taxes go about enforcing that patent?I think corporations should not pay taxes, that all profits except for those needed for asset innovation/repair and contingencies should be distributed to shareholders, and that all distributions should be taxed as normal income.There are more ramifications than that, I know, such as pension plans buying into companies etc, but those are issues that can be looked at rationally instead of through the incessant emotional fog and clouds of "free enterprise" and "capitalism" and so forth.Morgan Quinto Press ranked states by a number of education factors, including dropout and graduation rates, school test scores and proficiency ratings, teacher salaries, student-teacher ratios and public school spending.I highly doubt that anyone at a fortune 500 company is filing patent applications for tax strategies, but I can't read the NYTimes page to see if that's what's being alleged (CTJ does a great job of misdirection generally, and I suspect are at it again on their blog starting out with fortune 500 companies and then moving onto tax patents, without actually accusing them of filing for the patents).It is far more likely that the patents have been filed by some unscrupulous lawyers or CPAs and will be used merely as a technique to sell dubious strategies to unwitting taxpayers by waiving the patent in front of them and saying "look, the U.S. government approves!"I screwed up my last. I meant to say the real thomas is a dick-head. The fake thomas is totally cool. Real Thomas is a 67 year-old loser disconnected from reality (without drugs) who loves the attention I am giving him.I assume this is the real "Al," and not a parody Al. Thus, as a lawyer who works with copyright, trademark, and related doctrines, I will step up and explain that patent and other IP mechanisms are intended to distort the market - to create artificial scarcity and resulting monopoly rents. The Founders loathed monopolies, but felt that it was essential and in the public interest to establish monopolies for a limited time and with respect to strictly limited subject matter in order to create incentives. (It is not clear how this might be so regarding trademark, in which area Congress legislates not pursuant to its Art. I, sec. 8, cl. 8 copyright and patent power, but rather pursuant to the commerce clause.) Anyway, there was a great deal of teeth-gnashing and concern among the founders on this topic, and IP was embraced as a necessary evil, at best, specifically because it distorted the free market. The key, at the time, was the confidence that IP monopolies would be strictly construed and limited in duration (the first copyright term was 14 years, renewable once for another 14, and applied only to books, maps, and charts, IIRC). Now, of course - not so much. Thanks to Congress and the Fed Circuit giving away the farm, these days copyright and patent arguably do more harm than good (from the all-important public interest perspective, as emphasized in the Constitutional language) in some cases.Thus, as a lawyer who works with copyright, trademark, and related doctrines, I will step up and explain that patent and other IP mechanisms are intended to distort the market - to create artificial scarcity and resulting monopoly rents.That's true of copyrights and patents, but less so of trademarks (and similar things like protection of trade dress, etc.) that are largely intended to avoid accidental brand confusion, deliberate fraud, and confusing acts that produce results somewhere in between those extremes, and generally to promote clarity in commercial communications and promote an efficient, honest market.Mainstream democats now echo the anti-corporate rhetoric of the young Ralph Nader. If being progressive means going backward to the essentials of Marx and Lenin, Democrats are really progressives. And this from a party that is run by millionaires, both in the Congress and outside it. Mindboggling.Tripp @ 2:14, I'd love to see some injunction wars. As, no doubt, the IRS. Next question: would the IRS be prevented from making use of knowedge of the avoidance technique because the purpose to which the knowledge is applied is irrelevant to its protection as intellectual property?Moderates and conservatives appear to be indistinguishable; for liberals, you can flip the "advocacy" and "candidate" scores for moderates and conservatives.  I'm thinking that the "advocacy groups are probably more liberal" argument works.Seems foolish to trust either, even a little.  We've seen the Swift Boat ads and their ilk, and politicians just can't say much useful in 30 second spots.  They're manipulative and shallow, because that's all that works.Much better to read the more detailed positions of the candidates (on their websites or the underrated Voters Pamphlets) or listen to independant third parties that you've followed for long enough to trust.  Blogs can be good at this - while there are raving loonies, I know some that I can trust, like this one.It makes sense. Just look at what has been going on in the MA gubernatorial race. Healey is running some very nasty ads about Patrick. People inclined to vote for the GOP are likely to believe the attack ads and take Healey at her word since her attacks essentially reinforce preexisting conservative prejudices against liberals. Patrick's ads, on the other hand, are these overly optimistic and somewhat hokey spots about "hope" and "together we can" (ignore that he never mentions WHAT it is we CAN do together). I don't know anyone among Patrick supporters who takes his commercials with more than a very tiny grain of salt.Cult of personality. Conservatives are much more likely to sieze upon a person as honest or believable, and then believe what that person tells them; this relieves them of having to actually do any analysis themselves.I think this could be a proof of John Dean's assertion that conservatives favor authoritarian figures.  I.e. it's not the policy positions or ideas that matter so muc
