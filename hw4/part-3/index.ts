        text: "We reject this argument because section 5340 does not clearly impose a time requirement on when the billing by providers must occur. Rather, it can reasonably be read as requiring that, when billing does occur, it must be documented. Under the California system, provider billing of all third party liable resources was documented. Section 2089 of the California Medicaid Procedures Manual requires Regional Centers to bill insurance companies prior to seeking reimbursement from Medicaid for claims with other health coverage and requires them to maintain documentation of their efforts to recover third party reimbursement.California Ex. 43, Att. C. The fact that this billing and documentation occurs subsequent to California's claims for FFP for TCM services without other health coverage is not relevant to whether documentation occurs. Again, HCFA has focused on the timing of the billing and documentation process rather than the fact that California had a system for requiring billing as a prerequisite to claiming under Medicaid.Nor did the delay of some Regional Centers in billing third parties prejudice HCFA's legitimate interest in ensuring that states recover all possible third party reimbursement and that HCFA not participate in unnecessary costs. In this case, HCFA never disputed California's representation that its MEDS system eliminated claims with other health coverage from the federal claiming process until the Regional Centers completed their billing procedures. Therefore, not only did California's system satisfy all federal standards for cost avoidance systems, it also satisfied the purpose of those requirements: it excluded claims with potential health insurance coverage from the federal claiming process.Finally, while the majority of Regional Centers did not have functioning billing systems prior to the end of the disallowance period, the Regional Centers were not precluded from later billing for services which they had previously provided. In fact, this was required as a prerequisite for resubmitting a Medicaid claim. Information gathered by HCFA in the course of its review indicates that, after the end of the disallowance period, all of the Regional Centers either had billed or assured they would bill retroactively for services provided from July 1, 1988 for which other health coverage had been identified by the MEDS system. 11/ See HCFA Ex. AA and BB. For the preceding reasons, we conclude that, for all TCM services provided July 1, 1988 or after, California had established a cost avoidance system which satisfied applicable standards and prevented federal participation in costs which might be paid by insurance until providers had attempted to obtain such payment. Consequently, these services were not provided \"without charge.\"In order to compensate for its inability to identify and eliminate specific claims, California reduced the total units of TCM services provided by each of these four centers by 10%, a percent which it represented exceeded the units provided to recipients with other health coverage. State Ex. 55. It then multiplied the reduced number of units by the unit rate of each of the centers to calculate its FFP claim. Id.California's methodology for this period did not constitute seeking third party reimbursement and therefore these services were available \"without charge.\" California's third party reimbursement system is premised on the correlation of specific recipients with specific services and insurance coverage. The applicable requirements governing California's third party liability system do not contemplate reducing an FFP claim based on an estimate.The fact that California's inability to use its MEDS system to identify specific claims resulted from the length of time HCFA took to approve the amendment does not excuse California's inability to identify these claims. From almost the beginning of the amendment process, California program officials represented to HCFA that they would apply California's third party system to seek reimbursement for these costs. They knew or should have known that they could honor this representation only if they devised a way to retain the necessary information concerning other health coverage for individual TCM services. While a 10% reduction was a method for avoiding costs to the federal government, it was not a cost avoidance system meeting applicable state and federal requirements for seeking third party reimbursement.California argued that what California did should be viewed in the context of the real world, in which no health insurer is going to pay for TCM services in any event. California argued that the Board had recognized this in its prior decision, and that HCFA had acknowledged it to some extent by approving a plan amendment waiving cost avoidance in a slightly different context for other types of health services.As HCFA pointed out, however, with respect to the other health services mentioned by California, California had sought and obtained a waiver for application of a cost avoidance system. California did not do this with respect to TCM services, instead determining that TCM claims with other health coverage should be remitted to the Regional Centers for billing.Under a pay and recover system, the state pays the provider and then seeks reimbursement from the third party. Where probable existence of third party liability is established at the time a provider claim is filed, a state must use cost avoidance unless it has obtained a waiver from HCFA to use pay and recover. 42 C.F.R.  433.139(b). Where probable liability has not been established or benefits are not available at the time the claim is filed, a state may pay the provider and proceed itself against the third party. 42 C.F.R.  433.139(c).As part of its third party liability plan, California maintained a pay and recover system for seeking third party reimbursement when probable liability was not established or benefits were not available at the time the claim was filed. For TCM cases, this system involved recovery of TCM costs from tort-feasors and liability insurance companies.HCFA did not review California's pay and recover system. The parties faulted one another for the fact that HCFA did not review this part of California's system. California argued that it did not submit additional information because HCFA did not request it and therefore California had concluded that HCFA regarded the system as acceptable.We conclude that it is appropriate to consider California's pay and recover system in determining whether California sought third party reimbursement for these services. First, DAB No. 1285 made it clear that California's pay and recover system should be considered in whether TCM services were \"without charge.\" DAB No. 1285, at 15-19. Second, we do not read HCFA's requests for specific information from California as being directed to its pay and recover system. Moreover, HCFA was informed that the Board would consider California's pay and recover evidence prior to close of the record and prior to the final conference call in this case. HCFA did not offer contradictory evidence, did not request an opportunity to conduct a further review of California's system, and did not request a hearing in which to cross- examine California's declarants.DHS administers California's pay and recover system to recoup monies resulting from settlements and judgments obtained by Medi-Cal beneficiaries in personal injury actions. This system, or one essentially like it, has been in place since prior to the disallowance period. California Ex. 49, Declaration of Patricia A. Masuda, Chief of Personal Injury Unit, Third Party Liability Branch at 1. Pursuant to the system, DHS opens a recovery file on Medi-Cal beneficiaries whenever it has evidence of possible a possible personal injury action; determines through the Medi-Cal computer system how much Medi-Cal has paid on behalf of the recipient; files a Medi-Cal lien for these expenses; and recovers amounts to satisfy the lien. California Ex. 49, Third Party Liability Plan at 15.Prior to the submission of SPA 87-15, DHS operated this pay and recovery system pursuant to section 14124.71(a) of the California Welfare and Institutions Code. That statute provides that when Medi-Cal benefits have been or will be provided to a Medi-Cal recipient because of an injury for which another person is liable, or for which a carrier is liable, DHS may recover from the person or carrier the reasonable value of the benefits. While California maintained that this pre-existing statutory authority was sufficient to enable it to recover the costs of Medi-Cal TCM services (California Ex. 41), California supplemented its general mandate with statutory provisions specific to TCM services.In addition to amending its statutory authorization for its pay and recovery system, California included tort- feasor recovery in its inter-agency contracts between DHS and DDS. Section IV.I.1. of the 1987 contract provided that DHS would periodically review DDS' listing of TCM clients to identify cases with related tort actions and that Regional Centers were obligated to notify DDS of cases involving tort liability.California represented that it applied its pay and recover system to TCM costs by seeking to recover the costs of services to recipients with possible claims against third parties. State Ex. 49, Declaration at 1.Medicaid recipients with a DHS recovery file, the reports identify the recipient, the Regional Center providing the service, the charges, and the dates of service. The reports demonstrate that the TCM pay and recovery system was statewide, i.e., DHS received data and sought recovery for TCM services provided by all of the 21 Regional Centers.\"was in place during the disallowance period,\" we do not find this objection dispositive of whether these services were provided \"without charge.\" HCFA again focused on the timing of the final implementation rather tha",

        text: 'If you scrape your knee or break an arm, your body knows right what to do: make more skin or bone to replace the damaged tissue. But it\'s not that simple if what\'s hurt is your heart. When cardiac muscle is destroyed by a heart attack, cardiomyopathy, or other illness or injury, there are no replacement parts waiting in the wings.In some patients, a heart transplant or a mechanical device can help restore at least some of the lost function. But in most instances, the owner of the damaged heart is sentenced to a life of downward spiraling health as the surviving cells literally work themselves to death struggling to do the job of their fallen comrades. Soon, however, that picture may change. With the creation of the Center for Cardiovascular Repair (CCVR) at the University of Minnesota, the stage has been set for moving a revolutionary heart-mending strategy from the laboratory to real life.Known as cellular cardiomyoplasty, the approach involves infusing living cells from other parts of a person\'s body into his or her heart to restore lost function. This revolutionary approach has been shown to improve heart function in animals and has begun to be tested in humans, with encouraging preliminary results. The rigor of randomized clinical trials is next. CCVR director Doris Taylor should know better than just about anyone what promise this new technology has to offer. In 1998, Taylor led a research team at Duke University in North Carolina that published a paper showing improvement in the function of damaged heart tissue in rabbits after transplantation of leg muscle cells.  "All the pieces are in place here [at the U] to succeed," she says. Those pieces include a cadre of top-notch cardiologists and surgeons; the Stem Cell Institute, which offers opportunities to collaborate in exploring the use of adult stem cells for repairing not only heart but also vascular tissue; the Biomedical Engineering Institute, which can design almost anything we can imagine; the Lillehei Heart Institute; the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research; the Minnesota Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics Facility, which allows researchers to prepare cells under the rigorous conditions needed for human clinical trials; the local biomedical industry community; and what Taylor refers to as a "strong belief in innovation.""I was hired to be the catalyst," she says. "My job is to be a connector among the various aspects that are here and to really help bring together what might have seemed like disparate areas of research into a network, so that we can move ahead faster and better than anyone else and really be the place people think of when they think cardiovascular repair." To learn more about Doris Taylor, read "Hearty enthusiasm."Martha Rueter might have been spotted at cafes all across the Twin Cities the past three years, but she wasn\'t just sampling salads and sandwiches. Rueter, an associate professor of family social science, was meeting with community leaders to lay the groundwork for The Minnesota Diverse Families Project--an unprecedented study of what it takes for families to live a good life in a diverse Minnesota.Rueter is part of an interdisciplinary and multicultural research team from the College of Human Ecology--along with family social science colleagues Jean Bauer, Kathryn Rettig, William Turner, and Virginia Zuiker--that is probing what quality of life means to African American, American Indian, Asian American, and Hispanic families who call Minnesota home. Can a working-class Hispanic family living on the West Side of St. Paul enjoy as satisfying a quality of life as an affluent African American or Asian American family in southwest Minneapolis? How about an impoverished Native American family in Red Lake compared to a middle-class European American family in Bloomington? The answers probably are far from simple, suspects Rueter, who notes that "almost all quality-of-life assessment tools used today were developed to look at individuals, not families--and most were created by white researchers studying European Americans." "We have a lot of snapshot information about [overall] quality of life [in the state]," Rueter says. "[But] we know almost nothing about how quality of life is defined and experienced among minority racial and ethnic groups in Minnesota--even though the nonwhite population is now about 12 percent of our population and growing. And most important from a policy perspective, we don\'t know much about long-term quality of life [for those groups]--what improves or lessens it over time."What the researchers have learned, thus far, is that "the things traditionally associated with a high quality of life may not necessarily be in the same place on the list--or on the list at all--for families from nonmajority cultures," says Rueter.For example, "spiritual beliefs play a really important role in how [many ethnic] families experience quality of life," she explains. Among Southeast Asians, particularly the Hmong, "having a lot of children may be a more important indicator of quality of life than other indicators, such as income. Discrimination and other forms of oppression also may play a major role in shaping the quality-of-life experiences of minority families, she adds. For example, Native American community leaders describe "historical grief" as a likely impact on their quality-of-life perceptions. Once the researchers have established these significant quality-of-life components, they will conduct annual interviews with 25 families from each community to track "how and why families\' quality of life shifts over time, including the \'little things along the way\' that precipitate bigger shifts."Rueter says the study, "Tracking Changes in Quality of Life among Minnesota\'s Diverse Families," will help policymakers better meet the safety, health, and educational needs of the changing state population. The 2000 U.S. Census reports that Minnesota is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, and the State Demographic Center projects that by 2020, Minnesota\'s minority populations will increase to 15 percent of the total population, up from 6.3 percent in 1990. To read the complete story about this project, which is part of the President\'s Interdisciplinary Academic Initiative on Children, Youth, and Families, see "Completing the Picture."Over the next several months, Minnesota legislators will decide on the state biennial budget, which will include funding for the University for the next two years. The state\'s budgeting process officially began with the release of Governor Tim Pawlenty\'s biennial budget proposal at the end of January. The University fared very well in the governor\'s recommendations, according to University officials. "We are pleased that the governor recognized the need for investment in the U and believe these recommendations are a good start.  Now we need to take our case to the legislature," said Mike Dean, coordinator of the U\'s Legislative Network.During the coming weeks, legislators will begin making decisions on how to fund the numerous organizations that receive state support. Many of these organizations will work to influence  the budget decisions through letter writing, e-mails, and phone calls. That is why University advocates are stepping up their efforts as well."State legislators like hearing from their constituents," says former state representative Donna Peterson, who is director of the government relations office at the U. "They want to know what\'s important to the people in their district, and how they can help with their concerns. Supporters or advocates can give those heart-warming, first-hand accounts that can help legislators decide which public entities are deserving of state funding and how much they should get."And that\'s what the University is counting on come Wednesday, February 23. For the past two years the University has hosted Maroon and Gold Day at the Capitol. The half-day event is an opportunity for University students, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the public to demonstrate their support for the U, says Dean. Lions: another reason to visit the Capitol"The Lion\'s Mane," a new exhibit by the Bell Museum of Natural History featuring work by U researchers Craig Packer and Peyton West, will be on display at the Minnesota State Capitol from February 11 to 24. The exhibit includes one of the life-sized toy lions with interchangeable wigs that the researchers used to test the reactions of real lions to different lion mane sizes and colors."It\'s a day where University supporters can speak directly with legislators and see the legislative process at work," he says. "And this year, more than ever, speaking to legislators is important because the University cannot afford another round of budget cuts. Urging state leaders to reverse the trend of declining state support is key in maintaining a strong University for the state.To learn more about Maroon and Gold Day at the Capitol or to participate in the free activities, which will include a dinner at Coffman Union, see Legislative Network.For information about the University\'s capital and bonding requests, see www.umn.edu/govrel.He\'s been called a walking beer barrel, but Two-Ton Tony sure can punch.

        text: 'Reiterating his support for the troop "surge" to Iraq announced recently by President Bush, McCain said on NBC\'s "Meet the Press" that U.S. policy had produced Iraqi turmoil so bad that, if no change were made, "within months we would see a total breakdown in Iraq." The result, he said, would be ethnic cleansing between rival religious groups in the capital on the scale of that in Srebrenica, where Serbian military forces slaughtered 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in 1995."We can\'t expect Americans to sit outside Baghdad or outside the borders and watch such a thing go on," McCain said.While he said he preferred a larger troop buildup than the new 21,500-person deployment proposed by Bush, McCain said the new U.S. military commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, had assured him that if Petraeus "needed more, he would receive them."The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to take up resolutions on Iraq on Wednesday, some nonbinding and others that would cap the number of U.S. troops there or reduce future funding for American or Iraqi security forces.Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the committee and co-sponsor of a bipartisan, nonbinding resolution that would put senators on record as opposing Bush\'s plan, said votes on other approaches would not deliver a muddled message."There\'s an overwhelming . . . consensus that we should deescalate the war," he added during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday."Sen. Carl M. Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on the same program, "It will be a very powerful message if a bipartisan majority of the Congress say that they disagree with the increased military involvement in Iraq." He added that could only be a first step: "If the president does not take heed to that step, at that point, you then consider another step."Levin warned, however, "The worst thing we can do is to vote on something which is critical of the current policy and lose it, because if we lose that vote, the president will use the defeat of a resolution as support for his policy."Unlike Petraeus, Casey has been privately skeptical about the wisdom of deploying five new brigades now. He argued last year that the presence of U.S. troops was fostering an unhealthy Iraqi dependency on foreign assistance. After publicly embracing Bush\'s plan, however, Casey said that it could make Baghdad residents begin to feel safe in their neighborhoods by the end of the summer.McCain retorted yesterday: "It\'s taken us nearly four years to get to this desperate situation we\'re in today. So to think that within three or four months or a short period of time that we could retrieve the situation, I think, is just foolishness."McCain has previously sought to deny military promotions to officers whose work in Iraq displeased him, including several associated with policies that he said had led to the abuse of U.S. military detainees there. While not promising outright to oppose Casey\'s appointment, he said, "I have hard questions to ask him, and I\'m very skeptical about it."Levin has said he is inclined to back Casey.Meanwhile, McCain faces opposition from some Republican lawmakers who disagree with his endorsement of the troop buildup.Among the members of the Foreign Relations Committee, according to Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), "I don\'t believe there was one Republican senator who came forward with any kind of enthusiasm or any kind of strong support of the president\'s plan.""The party that I first voted for on top of a tank in the Mekong Delta in 1968 is not the party I see today," Hagel said on CBS\'s "Face the Nation" yesterday.As for the nonbinding resolution, McCain called it "basically a vote of no confidence in the men and women we are sending over there."McCain, whom polls have shown running neck and neck among potential voters with newly announced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, said yesterday that the senator from New York would make a "serious president." He did not reiterate his February 2005 comment that she would make a "good president."BAGHDAD, Jan. 21 -- The armored sport-utility vehicles whisked into a government compound in the city of Karbala with speed and urgency, the way most Americans and foreign dignitaries travel along Iraq\'s treacherous roads these days.Iraqi guards at checkpoints waved them through Saturday afternoon because the men wore what appeared to be legitimate U.S. military uniforms and badges, and drove cars commonly used by foreigners, the provincial governor said.Once inside, however, the men unleashed one of the deadliest and most brazen attacks on U.S. forces in a secure area. Five American service members were killed in a hail of grenades and gunfire in a breach of security that Iraqi officials called unprecedented.The attack, which lasted roughly 20 minutes, came on a day when the United States lost at least 20 other troops, including a dozen in a helicopter crash, making it the third most lethal day for American forces in Iraq.Meanwhile, the military announced the arrival of 3,200 troops of the 82nd Airborne Division\'s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, the first unit to reach Baghdad as part of a 21,500-troop increase that the Bush administration hopes will restore order in the violent capital."Soldiers from the 82nd come to us ready to engage in a wide variety of operations in support of the Iraqi Baghdad Security Plan," Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the second-ranking U.S. commander in Iraq, said in a statement. "The brigade adds operational flexibility that will assist in securing the population."U.S. military officials said Sunday that they could not discuss the attack in Karbala in detail because it remained under investigation. But they said the version of events provided by the governor\'s office was consistent with their preliminary findings.After arriving at the Provincial Joint Coordination Center in Karbala, 60 miles southwest of Baghdad, the attackers detonated sound bombs, Iraqi officials said. "They wanted to create a panic situation," said an aide to Karbala Gov. Akeel al-Khazaali, who described the events with the governor\'s permission but on condition of anonymity because he fears reprisals.The men then stormed into a room where Americans and Iraqis were making plans to ensure the safety of thousands of people expected to visit the holy city for an upcoming holiday."They didn\'t target anyone but the American soldiers," the governor\'s aide said.After the attack, the assailants returned to their vehicles and drove away. It was unclear how many people participated, and the men\'s identities and motive remained unclear, but the attack was particularly striking because of the resources and sophistication involved, Iraqi officials said.The men drove off toward the city of Babil, north of Karbala, where they shot at guards at a checkpoint, said Capt. Muthana Ahmad, a police spokesman. Vehicles later recovered contained three bodies and one injured individual. The U.S. military took possession of the vehicles, the spokesman said.Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had a surprise for President Bush when they sat down with their aides in the Four Seasons Hotel in Amman, Jordan. Firing up a PowerPoint presentation, Maliki and his national security adviser proposed that U.S. troops withdraw to the outskirts of Baghdad and let Iraqis take over security in the strife-torn capital. Maliki said he did not want any more U.S. troops at all, just more authority.The president listened intently to the unexpected proposal at their Nov. 30 meeting, according to accounts from several administration officials. Bush seemed impressed that Maliki had taken the initiative, but it did not take him long to reject the idea.By the time Bush returned to Washington, the plan had already been picked through by his military commanders. At a meeting in the White House\'s Roosevelt Room, the president flatly told his advisers that the Maliki plan was not going to work. He had concluded that the Iraqis were not up to the task and that Baghdad would collapse into chaos, making a bad situation worse. And so the Americans would have to help them.From that early December meeting on, Bush was headed down a path that would result in his defying critics and the seeming message of the November elections by ordering 21,500 more U.S. troops to Iraq. A reconstruction of the administration\'s Iraq policy review, based on more than a dozen interviews with senior advisers, Bush associates, lawmakers and national security officials, reveals a president taking the lead in driving the process toward one more effort at victory -- despite doubts along the way from his own military commanders, lawmakers and the public at large.He never seriously considered beginning to withdraw U.S. forces, as urged by newly elected Democratic congressional leaders and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. And he had grown skeptical of his own military commanders, who were telling him no more troops were needed.So Bush relied on his own judgment that the best answer was to try once again to snuff out the sectarian violence in Baghdad, even at the risk of putting U.S. soldiers into a crossfire between Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias. When his generals resisted sending more troops, he seemed irritated. When they finally agreed to go along with the plan, he doubled the number of troops they requested.It was a signature moment for a president who seems uninfluenced by the electorate on Iraq and headed for a showdown with the new Democratic Congress. Presented with an opportunity to pull back, Bush instead chose to extend and, in some ways, deepen his commitment, gambling that more time and a new plan will finally bring success to the troubled U.S. military mission."The guy who is most committed to winning and finding a way to win is the president. He always has been; he\'s the only reason we are still in this fight," said Frederick W. Kagan, a military historian at the American Enter',

        text: 'John 5-8. In the "Shepherd\'\' of Hermas 38.10 (Mand. 8.10) hospitality is distinctly mentioned in the catalogue of virtues, with this remarkable comment: ἐν γὰρ τῇ φιλοξενίᾳ εὑρίσκεται ἀγαθοποίησίς ποτε ("for benevolence from time to time is found in hospitality"), while in 76.3 (Sim. 8.10.3), praise is assigned to those Christians who ἡδέως εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν ὑπεδέξαντο τοὺς δούλους τοῦ θεοῦ ("gladly welcomed God\'s servants into their houses"). Aristides, in his Apology (15.7), says that if Christians "see any stranger, they take him under their roof and rejoice over him as over a very brother" (ξένον ἐὰν ἴδωσιν ὑπὸ στέγην εἰσάγουσι καὶ χαίρουσιν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ὡς ἐπὶ ἀδελφῷ ἀληθινῷ).The exercise of hospitality by private individuals towards Christian brethren is assumed by Tertullian to be a duty which no one dare evade; for, in writing to his wife (ad Uxor. 2.4), he warns her against marrying a heathen, should he (Tertullian) predecease her, on the ground that no Christian brother would get a spiritual reception in an alien household. But hospitality was inculcated especially upon officials of the church, such as elders (bishops) and deacons, who practiced this virtue in the name of the church at large; cp. 1 Tim. 3.2, Tit. 1.8 (1 Tim. 5.10). In Hermas 104.2 (Sim. 9.27.2) hospitable bishops form a special class among the saints, since "they gladly received God\'s servants into their houses at all times, and without hypocrisy." In [[178b]] the Didache a comparatively large amount of space is taken up with directions regarding the care of travelers, and Cyprian\'s interest in strangers is attested by his seventh letter, written to his clergy at Carthage from his place of retreat during the Decian persecution. He writes: "I beg you will attend carefully to the widows, and sick people, and all the poor. You may also pay the expenses of any strangers who may be in need, out of my own portion which I left with my fellow-presbyter Rogatianus. In case it should be all used, I hereby forward by the hands of Naricus the acolyte another sum of money, so that the sufferers may be dealt with more promptly and liberally" ("Vίduαrum et infirmorum et omnium pauperum curam peto diligenter habeatis, sed et peregrinis si qui indigentes fuerint sumptus suggeratis de quantitate mea propria quam apud Rogatianum compresbyterum nostrum dimisi. Quae quantitas ne forte iam erogata sit, misi eidem per Naricum acoluthum aliam portionem, ut largius et promptius circa laborantes fiat operatio"). Cp. also Apost."Peregrinus thus started out for the second time, and betook himself to traveling; he had an ample allowance from the Christians, who constituted themselves his bodyguard, so that he lived in clover. Thus for some time he provided for himself in this fashion." From the pseudo-Clementine epistle de Virginitate one also learns to appreciate the appeal and exercise of hospitality. Finally, Julian (Ep. ad Arsac.) emphasizes ἡ περὶ τοὺς ξένους φιλανθρωπία among Christians, and wishes that his own party would imitate it (see above, p. 162).It was easy to take advantage of a spirit so obliging and [[180]] unsparing (e.g., the case of Proteus Peregrinus, and especially the churches\' sad experience of so-called prophets and teachers). Heretics could creep in, and so could loafers or impostors. We note, accordingly, that definite precautions were taken against these at quite an early period. The new arrival is to be tested to see whether or not he is a Christian (cp. 2 and 3 John; Did.Passport from his church at home. Things must have come to a sad pass when (as the Didache informs us) it was decreed that any visitor must be adjudged a false prophet without further ado, if during an ecstasy he ordered a meal and then partook of it, or if in an ecstasy he asked for money. Many a traveler, however, who desired to settle down, did not come with empty hands; such persons did not ask, they gave. Thus we know (see above) that when Marcion came from Pontus and joined the Roman church, he contributed 200,000 sesterces to its funds (Tert., de Praescr. 30).Cor. 12.26). And there is no doubt whatever that the consciousness of this was most vigorous and vital [[181]] in the very ages during which no external bond as yet united the various churches, the latter standing side by side in almost entire independence of each other. These were the ages when the primitive article of the common symbol, "I believe in one holy church," was really nothing more than an article of faith. And of course the effect of the inward ties was all the stronger when people were participating in a common faith which found expression ere long in a brief and vigorous confession, or practicing the same love and patience and Christian discipline, or turning their hopes in common to that glorious consummation of Christ\'s kingdom of which they had each received the earnest and the pledge.Poverty, sickness, persecution, and suffering of all kinds formed one class of troubles which demanded constant help on the part of churches that were better off; while, in a different direction, assistance was required in those internal crises of doctrine and of conduct which might threaten a church and in fact endanger its very existence. Along both of these lines the brotherly love of the churches had to prove its reality.It was a Gentile Christian church which was the first, so far as we are aware, to help a sister church in her distress. Shortly after this, the brotherly love felt by young Christian communities drawn from pagans in Asia and Europe is reported to have approved itself on a still wider scale. Even after the famine had passed, the mother church at Jerusalem continued poor. Why, we do not know. An explanation has been sought in the early attempt by which that church is said to have introduced a voluntary community of goods; it was the failure of this attempt, we are to believe, that left the local church impoverished. This is merely a vague conjecture. Nevertheless, the poverty at Jerusalem remains a fact. At the critical conference in Jerusalem, when the three pillar-apostles definitely recognized Paul\'s mission to the Gentiles, the latter pledged himself to remember the poor saints at Jerusalem in distant lands; and the epistles to the Galatians, the Corinthians, and the Romans, show how widely and faithfully the apostle discharged this obligation. His position in this matter was by no means easy. He had made himself responsible for a collection whose value depended entirely on the voluntary devotion of the churches which he founded.Corinth being endangered by a severe local crisis, he did not fail to remember the business of the collection along with more important matters. The local arrangements for it had almost come to a standstill by the time he wrote, and the aim of his vigorous, affectionate, and graceful words of counsel to the church is to revive the zeal which had been allowed to cool amid their party quarrels (2 Cor. 8.9). Not long afterwards he is able to tell the Romans that "those of Macedonia and Achaia freely chose to make a certain contribution for the poor saints at Jerusalem. They have done it willingly, and indeed it was a debt. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister to them in secular things"Neither statement explains if it was only members of the particular church in question who were thus supported. This, however, is inherently improbable, and there are express statements to the contrary, including one from a pagan source.Christians about the year 170: "From the very first you have had this practice of aiding all the brethren in various ways and of sending contributions to churches in manyevery city, thus in one case relieving the poverty of the needy, or in another providing for brethren in the mines. By these gifts, which you have sent from the very first, you Romans keep up the hereditary customs of the Romans, a practice your bishop Soter has not merely maintained but even extended." A hundred years later Dionysius, the bishop of Alexandria, in writing to Stephen the bishop of Rome, has occasion to mention the churches in Syria and Arabia. Whereupon he remarks in passing, "To them you send help regularly, and you have just [[185]] written them another letter"Cyprian. From a number of letters written shortly before his execution, it is quite clear that Cyprian sent money to provide for the Christians who then lay captive in Numidia (Ep. 76-79), and elsewhere in his correspondence there is similar evidence of his care for stranger Christians and foreign churches. The most memorable of his letters, in this respect, is that addressed to the bishops of Numidia in 253 C.E.The latter had informed him that wild hordes of robbers had invaded the country and carried off many Christians of both sexes into captivity. Whereupon Cyprian instituted a collection on their behalf and forwarded the proceeds to the bishops along with the following letter (Ep.Paul: Should one member suffer, all the others suffer along with it; and should one member rejoice, the others rejoice with it also. And in another place he says: Who is weak, and I am not weak? We must therefore consider the present imprisonment of our brethren as our imprisonment, reckoning the grief of those in peril as our grief. We form a single body in our union, and we ought to be stirred and strengthened by religious duty as well as by love to redeem our members the brethren."For as the apostle Paul once more declares: Know ye not that ye are God\'s temple and that the Holy Spirit dwelleth in you? Though love failed to stir us to succor the brethren, we must in this case consider that it is temples of Go',

        text: "With regards to Saudi Arabia, the ruling system is monarchial which contradicts Islam. Article 5(a) of the constitution states, \"The system of government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is that of a monarchy.\"The economic solutions also contradict Islam on a number of different levels. With respect to oil we find that it is not public property but is largely privately owned, which is the case in Saudi Arabia - Aramco.We also find that economic solutions are dervied from free market thinking, which is evident in the privatisation process in Iran. The problem here is with the basis of thinking. Islam specifies what is public, private and state ownership. Iran is going from one extreme to another, from nationalisation to privatisation.I ask this because I consider respectful peer-based relationships and constructive coexistence across ethnic, religious, class, etc. lines to be *the* toughest challenge to democracy; people of like mind can and do establish some very smoothly operating communities on small (sub-national) scales, but there seems to be a size limit and it appears to be closely related to considerations of how large a group one can find where most of the people are an ideological match.We live *today* under a global economic regime which continually redistributes wealth...UPWARD.  This regime is very much based upon massive and routine violence, both through state and non-state actors.Muslims seem to follow the same pattern as adherents of other faiths when it comes to politicoeconomic systems, i.e. you have a handful of people who stick up for economic justice within any faith, but the majority take the windvane approach and just go along with whatever regime is dominant.In Islam we can see things like Ramadan, which involve clear appeals to consider the plight of the poor.  In Christianity we have things like the \"eye of the needle\" passage and a host of callings to transcend the temporal world of earthly possessions in favor of spiritual wealth.  In Judaism there is the notion of healing the world...and so on for every major faith community I can think of.However, the overwhelming majority of adherents to each of these faiths seems perfectly content to settle for piecemeal gestures towards economic justice while tolerating (if not openly celebrating and participating in) inherently exploitative and violent economic regimes.The minority who stick up for the oppressed are what makes it possible for me to see some worth in religion...while the majority who don't are what inspires me to maintain a general suspicion of the integrity of their faith.I'm jumping in late because I've been out of town. I have a review copy of New Civ. It's a good looking magazine and I admire its goal of fostering dialogue. It makes some interesting points and, I think, dubious ones. Generally I'm wondering if, given its attempt to be steadfastly grounded in Islam, it can have much appeal beyond the Islamic community. I also wonder how representative of modern Islamic thought it is. Is it really offering me a window into the thinking of a significant portion of the non-western intellectual world?So, before we take a step further in the argument we're encountering considerable problems -- the existence of God et al. But I'm willing to go along with the premise just to see how the argument turns out.\"Rather Islam views people in their capacity as human beings and citizens of the Islamic State. So no differentiation is made between Muslims and non-Muslims, both are viewed in their capacity as human beings and are treated as such by the Islamic rules.\"This is, I suppose, an admirable attempt to embrace diversity but it's chock full of problems when you think it through. Imagine the ideal Islamic State exists. Could non-muslims (and by non-muslims I mean those who reject Allah, the Quran as a miracle, Mohammed as the prophet and the legitimacy of Islamic Law) really have a significant place in the Caliphate? Wouldn't the system be intrinsically biased toward Islamic beliefs, making it extremely difficult for someone who did not accept them to assume a position of authority?As my limited understanding of Islam, I see an \"inner self\" way, an intuitive divine truth of the individual very similar to the native American Iroquois where The Creator speak to individual hearts, prayerful, meditative hearts of average people. From reading these postings I feel conformation for this view. It's a good place to start building bridges of understanding... and healthy economies.I have always been impressed at how Islam has specific controls on rates of return on loans and not requiring payments out when there are no profits made. I wish I could put my humble checking account into a bank with this kind of ethic.I tend to take these things as a given because economic thinking and solutions are derived from a capitalist context. That is to say we find that there are different interpretations and models of capitalism but nonetheless these models in their generality are the same but differ in the specifics. The economies of Europe and America differ on many issues especially areas of social justice where socialism has a much stronger influence upon European economics than it does in America.\"Our third great task is to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world. I spoke earlier of the grave setbacks to democracy in the first half of the 20th century. The second half of the century saw an advance of democracy that was far more dramatic. In the last quarter of that century, the number of democracies in the world tripled. And in the last six months of this new century alone, we have witnessed the peaceful, democratic transfer of power in Malaysia, a majority Muslim nation, and in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population. We have seen men and women wait in line for hours to vote in Afghanistan's first ever free and fair presidential election.\"\"We also must realize that America and all free nations are facing a generational struggle against a new and deadly ideology of hatred that we cannot ignore. We need to do much more to confront hateful propaganda, dispel dangerous myths, and get out the truth. We will increase our exchanges with the rest of the world. And Americans should make a serious effort to understand other cultures and learn foreign languages. Our interaction with the rest of the world must be a conversation, not a monologue. And America must remain open to visitors and workers and students from around the world, without compromising our security standards. If our public diplomacy efforts are to succeed, we cannot close ourselves off from the world. And if I am confirmed, public diplomacy will be a top priority for me and for the professionals I lead.\"IMHO  \"Western\" and \"Islamic\" civilizations are more similar than not, and may there be mercy on any other civilizations that lay in their path. Both are coated with no shortage of destructive tendencies while sharing the immediate painful mutual need for an equitable 'social index'.Farooq, I think your response to my puzzlement is a fairly accurate characterization of the US position.  The problem to which I was alluding, though, is that I think the US position has generally been misguided.  I say so mainly because a survey of what routinely takes place in developing nations ought to be seen as convincing evidence that trying to impose democracy on a people who are living in utter abject poverty is ALSO a recipe for disaster, as the sheer number of coups in sub-Saharan Africa in the past, say, 50 years, clearly demonstrates.It takes time and patience to develop democracy to the point where the masses can benefit from it.  And time and patience are difficult to come by among people who are hungry.  Democracy requires stability in order to take root, and there can be no stability among a population that is suffering from an array of ills that plague the underdeveloped world, such as lack of food, lack of access to clean water, disease, etc.  That's the reason why many development economists believe that development must occur first before democracy.  Hungry people don't care about capitalism versus socialism.  They just want to eat.  Once they and their children are fed, clothed, sheltered, and healthy, they can then begin to think about what type governance they believe will be best for them in the long run.It is absurd that a nation that isn't a democracy itself could, let alone would, attempt to work for democracy elsewhere.  There are plenty of individuals and groups who strive for substantive democracy, but (suprise!) they don't work from within a state apparatus.It is even more absurd that democracy, which by its most fundamental definition is based upon true reflection of the political will of the people, could ever be imposed from without (though once again, that's clearly NOT what is even being attempted).  Even in those circumstances where (arguably) most people in a particular society truly do want substantive democracy, it must be spearheaded and achieved by the people themselves.  Potential outside allies can help *when invited*, but not otherwise.Making a fetish of the *superficial procedural* sense of \"democracy,\" in which the mere presence or absence of formal voting mechanisms is the litmus test (regardless of whether or not such voting actually DOES anything substantive to/for the de facto policies of a regime) is an insulting trivialization of democracy.  Substantive democracy does require some kind of mechanism for people to express their political will, but expression without effect is only marginally less coercive and repressive a situation than barring political expression outright.Since the 1860's when U.S. Army suppliers took over the government and created a deficit spending/tax everyone, military industrial complex, Big Business Interests have used \"democratic freedom\" rhetoric to pull the wool over the world's as well as the Am",

        text: "I think a second factor that accounts for the great satisfaction reported -- and, of course, I have to say this is self-reported, so, you know, I can't say J.D. Powers said this, but there's a dearth of other information.Nonetheless, I think that one of the reasons that we've been so successful is that our operators and our passengers have a willingness to negotiate the experience, which is to say that the very concerns that Don Backe just mentioned have been made a matter of conversation between the prospective passenger and the prospective carrier, and they've worked it out, and quite apparently to everyone's satisfaction.There's a saying that there are only three rules to seamanship, okay: you keep the water on the outside, you keep the people on the inside, and you keep the boat off the land. Anything after that's gravy.Well, you can say the same thing about surveying the disabled population in vessels. You get them on the boat safely, you give them the best experience you can that's as close as possible to what everybody else gets, and you get them off the boat safely. Cucharacha, that's it. The rest of it's details.And the fact of it is we have been doing that. I think the major problem with that option, though, is this inevitable tendency to start getting down and saying, well, you know, we need to be more specific about this and say that a person needs to be put on in thus and such a way. Or, you know, the more specific those performance recommendations become, the more and more they begin to look like what? They begin to look like the C&T rules in option 2.In option 4, I think, basically, there is no magic number when it comes to passengers. The fact of it is, as Paul pointed out, we inherited this, obviously, to some extent arbitrary line from the Coast Guard and from their relatively recently overhauled framework of vessel classification.I have to say that, even though it was not purpose made for us, it does, I think, reflect some very valuable characteristics, some of which are economically driven and some of which are feasible or infeasible as a matter of physics.The fact of it is you are never going to find a 51-passenger cruise ship. It just is never going to happen because it's not economically feasible. You are probably not going to find a 60-passenger cruise ship. I mean, at some point, you know, there is a number there where economic feasibility makes it possible.And, likewise, I think that what this really points to is that probably more important than some sort of arbitrary number of passengers are the programmatic aspects of what the vessel does, all right, because that is also going to be interrelated with the physical thing.It's very unlikely that you're going to find a 5,000-person sailing ship. It's very unlikely you're going to find a 50-person cruise ship. Okay? So, as predictors go, you know, the size and the number of people have to be taken with the actual intended design of the vessel. And, once again, I think we did that pretty well.And what I'm going to bring to you today are three issues that I'd like you to consider. And I'll give you a brief background, and then I'll get out of here. The access from vessel to shore of 1 and 12, the exemptions for that or the exceptions for that are critical in our operation, and I'll come back and talk about that later. And, by the way, I do appreciate all the work that the Passenger Vessel Access committee did. It was really good work.Three is where we'll lead a little bit away from our Passenger Vessel Association. We feel that -- Casco Bay Island Transit District feels that the demarcation line is arbitrary at 150 passengers. There should be a subchapter, a super K or 600 passengers would be more realistic. Our little ferries, although they seem big to some, it's very difficult in the environment we operate in to meet all of the requirements.But let me just go over and tell you very quickly about our operation. I think one of the things I'm proudest of, the Casco Bay Island Transit District came into being in 1982 when the bankrupt Casco Bay Lines went into receivership. And, starting in 1984, we've had a record of every time we've dealt with the boat we've tried to improve its accessibility. We've never denied anybody transportation. We help everybody on and off the boat. We have two deckhands at the gangway any time we're operating.And, in 1985, we designed our first ferry, made sure it had handicapped accessible heads, an area for wheelchairs. In 1987, when the ferry terminal was built, we made sure it met all the requirements.In 1994, when we built our first passenger boat, we had an elevator between decks. So, a 399 passenger boat, we put an elevator between decks. In 1998, we retrofitted the Island Romance, a 65-foot boat. We couldn't put an elevator in it because the boat was too small, but we did put a lift in it. We call it a passenger lift. I'm not quite sure where that fits between a lulu and a platform lift, but we put a passenger lift in there.Our new boat that is currently under construction, the Aucocisco III, is replacing a 38-year-old ferry, the Island Holiday. And, once the Board and staff came to visit us, we submitted our plans and asked for and consequently made changes in the design of the boat to try and make it more accessible.So, I mean, our effort has been to try to make our operation accessible, and it's not for all altruistic reasons. I think it's the right thing to do, but I think it's good business sense. The thing I'm asking for today is that we keep everything realistic.Our tidal range is upwards of 14 feet. We have to operate the fixed piers. We cannot put floats in. They get blown away. Any time we have any kind of severe weather, anybody who is operating on all floats, they're hurting in Maine.In our case, we have fixed piers on the islands; we don't have steel vessels. We have a fixed facility in Portland. When we looked at designing the ferry terminal to put a ramp that would meet the 1 and 12 at the ferry terminal, it would start at the waterside and run through our entire building and be out as far as the parking lot. And I don't say that to be humorous. I'm just telling you, that's the kind of conditions we're having to deal with in Maine. And, again, what we try to do is we've designed and worked with the Maine Department of Transportation as they built the fixed docks and the down bay islands. It used to be that you just had a top level, and then a midrange or a low level.We've actually put in intermittent level ramps so that we can actually meet the standard about half the time. But the other half of the time, we won't be close to meeting the standard if it were required to remain at 1 and 12.The other exception is the so-called grandfathering. And, again, I want to tell you that operations like ours are going to try every way we can to continue to keep our boats accessible, but I'm concerned about whether we'd be required, if we did any major alterations to one of our smaller boats, that we'd have to put an elevator in it, as opposed to a passenger lift. From a stability standpoint and a space standpoint, it would be very difficult.We have a little concern about also our car ferry that we built in 1985 that we put accessible heads and areas for wheelchairs to be located and assistance to be able to sit by them. We did that back in 1985. That is a three-deck boat. It does not have an elevator to either the second or third deck. That would be a major concern if we did something of major alteration where we'd have to put an elevator on that boat. There's just no room on it right now. But I just want to make sure that I got that mentioned.The last, and probably the most difficult maybe for you, and I've been told this is the hardest nut to crack, is the idea of the arbitrariness of establishing a 150 passenger limit for small versus large.And it's difficult to think of the idea that only through the mastery of the naval architecture profession that you could actually cram 300 people on this boat. It's actually a small boat. So we would encourage you to at least consider that.I'll be glad to answer any questions. I have my comments that I'll pass along to staff and then we'll, of course, make our written comments. We do want to echo the statement made by Ed Welch that any extension of time, especially if we get 60 or 90 days beyond the current I guess it's March 28 deadline, would be helpful because we spent a lot of time trying to read the regulations. I can't pretend to tell you that I really understand them or the impact of them, but we would like to have a little more time to think through this. Questions?Anyway, Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating, we go by the acronym CRAB, and I am the big crab or the head crab. But my interest has been basically in sailing craft and basically in the smaller sailing craft. And my participation in this committee represented that interest, and my interjections came from that perspective. And I think you need to know that.Some things need to be said about sailing craft which are different about these large vessels. I'm delighted to go on a large princess-style ship because it is just hunky dory compared to the challenges we face with smaller craft and sailing craft.Sailing craft, in a way, are quite a challenge for people with mobility impairments particularly because balance is important. And, if you think about it, sailing craft are asked to do things that your power craft are not.For instance, one of the absolute facts of sailing craft, especially monohulls -- that's sailing -- single-hulled sailing watercraft -- is that they heel. So, in fact, if they're small, the minute you step on them, they're out of ADA. They're bobbing up and down at the dock. They're perilous just getting on them, especially if the day is rough. So the dynamics are very challenging to people with mobility impairments.I have -- my first 52 years of my life I was able-bodie",

While some new journal titles may be added for 2005, they will not affect the price of each collection in the way that the addition of new content has done in the past. If MUSE has a significant number of new high quality titles wishing to participate, MUSE will explore/consider the development of a new collection.Libraries do still have the option of subscribing on a title-by-title basis to any journal for which the publisher has opted to have MUSE sell single titles. They may subscribe to single titles at the rates set by the publishers in addition to holding a collection subscription. At this time MUSE does not have the functionality to provide individualized flex plans for a discounted price, but MUSE will continue to offer a consortium flex plan (at least 5 libraries, and at least 100 titles must be selected, and the final discount will be based on the total number of each).For the purposes of pricing, Project MUSE categorizes North American academic libraries into tiers based upon Carnegie Classification. This criterion was chosen because it represents, in essence, the level of research activity at an institution and its relation to the institution\'s mission. Carnegie Classification is a commonly-agreed upon typology, is determined by a respected third-party organization, and had widespread acceptance among MUSE subscribers as an acceptable categorization tool during pricing research. Because Canadian institutions are not classified by the Carnegie Foundation, these institutions have been "mapped" into the five pricing tiers based upon similar criteria related to research activity and educational mission.UNAIDS has five focus areas including: leadership and advocacy, strategic information and technical support, tracking monitoring and evaluation, civil society engagement and mobilization of resources.There have been steady improvements in the modelling methodology used by UNAIDS/WHO and partners, along with better data from country surveillance. These have led to lower global HIV/AIDS estimates, not just for the current year but also for past years, despite the continued expansion of the global epidemic. Current estimates therefore cannot be compared directly with estimates from previous years, nor with those that may be published subsequently.UNAIDS and WHO continue to work with countries, partner organizations and experts to improve data collection. These efforts will ensure that the best possible estimates are available to assist governments, non-governmental organizations and others in gauging the status of the epidemic and monitoring the effectiveness of prevention and care efforts.The reach, expertise and institutional resources of the business sector are vital for a broadened and strengthened AIDS response. Workplace programmes developed in full partnership with unions or workforce representatives can help ensure broad-based participation by workers as their involvement engenders ownership, less fear of discrimination, greater trust of prevention messages, and higher take-up of services such as testing and treatment.Economic impact of HIV By targeting predominantly young and middle-aged adults who are the mainstay of the economy and the principal support of their families, the epidemic destroys the very fabric of societies. Particularly in places where HIV prevalence is high, it hamstrings economic growth and makes the provision of social services more difficult. Read more...UN system staff and bureaucracies are often unfamiliar and uncomfortable with dealing with non-state actors. Despite recent changes most UN staff still view their primary working relationship to be with government.Current UN Reform processes have only had minimal involvement of civil society. For example, the recently launched report on UN System-Wide Coherence speaks little to the primary importance of the role of civil society with an emphasis of internal UN processes.Antiretroviral therapyARVs have proved very effective at treating people with AIDS. But they are not a cure. If treatment is discontinued the virus becomes active again, so a person on ARVs must take them for life. More...TuberculosisMore than one third of the world\'s population is infected with the TB bacillus. People with healthy immune systems keep the bacillus in check and do not develop active disease. But because HIV destroys the immune system, people living with the virus are at extremely high risk of developing tuberculosis. More...Stigma and discriminationTogether, stigma and discrimination constitute one of the greatest barriers to dealing effectively with the epidemic. They discourage governments from acknowledging or taking timely action against AIDS. They deter individuals from finding out about their HIV status. More...Halting and reversing the spread of AIDS by 2015 demands far greater access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support than is currently available. Ultimately, it requires universal access to a comprehensive range of services. UNAIDS and its partners are working with countries to reach the goal of universal access for all those who need it by 2010.

Particularly in places where HIV prevalence is high, it hamstrings economic growth and makes the provision of social services more difficult. More...HIV and securityAIDS and global insecurity co-exit in a vicious cycle. Civil and international conflicts help spread HIV as populations are destabilized, and armies move across new territories. At the same time, the epidemic contributes to national and international insecurity through high levels of HIV infection among military and peacekeeping personnel. More...Each day, 14,000 more people become newly infected with HIV. More than half of them are young people between the ages of 15 and 24. In many countries and communities, there is a refusal to even discuss AIDS, let alone admit that young people should be responsible for their choices and actions.More than 130 different youth groups from around the world participated the debates. The long term objectives of this project are to empower young people to build their capacities for participation and action, and to increase active collaboration between youth organizations from the North and the South.Women are leaders in many areas of the AIDS response but too often interventions are not adapted to their realities leaving them at greater risk of HIV infection and at a disadvantage when it comes to coping with AIDS.Men and boys and wider communities must be encouraged to fulfil their potential as positive forces for change in improving the situation of women and girls. Efforts to foster more equitable and respectful gender relations are essential.Education in schoolsYoung people in many parts of the world are denied sex and health education in schools because parents and other authorities fear it encourages early sexual activity. But there is compelling evidence from studies conducted around the world and in many different cultures that, in fact, sex education encourages responsibility. More...Education outside school settingsExperience shows that peer education, which involves training representatives among out-of-school youth to convey information, is one of the most effective strategies. More...The goal of this public awareness campaign is to improve the understanding of HIV and the issues that HIV positive people have to deal with, it also aims at reducing AIDS-related in the workplace and in promoting safer environments for people to disclose their status and access necessary services. The one-year campaign is a joint initiative of the Irish Department of Health and Children and the Department of Foreign Affairs.The first time Chinese TV star Wenli Jiang took part in a public HIV prevention and awareness raising event, in 2003, she was decidedly nervous. Standing on a temporary stage set up in the most popular shopping section in Beijing, she looked out at the shoppers, holding a sheaf of condoms in her hand.Expanded HIV prevention programmes targeting sexual transmission and transmission among injecting drug users could avert 28 million new HIV infections between 2005 and 2015. A new study, published in Sciencexpress, indicates that increased spending on HIV prevention would not only prevent more than half the new infections that would occur from 2005 to 2015, but would actually produce a net financial saving as future costs for treatment and care are averted.A. No, in fact I have always viewed doing nothing as not being an option. Using our global network to communicate HIV prevention messages is one of the most important things we can do to contribute to this cause. I would like to encourage other companies to play to their strengths and look at how they can contribute too. We all have a role to play.Q. This past World AIDS Day, after completing an enormously successful eighteen months as the Chair of the Global Media AIDS Initiative (GMAI) Leadership Committee, you turned the position over to Dali Mpofu. Kofi Annan sang your praises: "Bill Roedy has mobilized media companies around the world to make unprecedented commitments to HIV prevention through innovative campaigns and programming." Can you explain why prevention efforts are still so important?A. Prevention efforts are still important because the worldwide response to HIV and AIDS has not matched the scale of the disease. 40 million people are infected. Prevention is important because no one needs to contract HIV. Education can prevent infection. The UN believes that effective education programmes can significantly cut infection rates.I want the media and business to show glob',

This could be done over a week, individually or in small groups. Color is often the first attribute that students sort by. Other categories include size, screw-on or snap-on, type of container (water, soda, or sports drink bottles, ketchup bottle, mayonnaise jar, or milk jug), and one-piece or flip-top.It is convenient to begin with a collection of human-made items but students should also work with a collection of natural items to build knowledge about the natural world.

The story has a pattern, and every page is an opportunity for students to ask (and answer) what will happen next in the book.A group of objects of various weights and surfaces, small enough to fit into the containers: a Ping-Pong ball, a plastic egg, various blocks, a large coin, a small paper cup, a feather, a cotton ball, and a marble. Use objects that are familiar to the students.Mary Ann Hoffman is an English as a Second Language Teacher in Alexandria, Virginia, and the parent of four young children. She believes that children acquire language skills and are inspired to ask questions when they investigate new concepts using as many senses and methods as possible.Classify Insects: Zoom in on True Bugshttp://teacher.scholastic.com/activities/explorations/bug/level1/investigate.htmClick on the name of a tool to see a photograph of it being used by an entomologist.Afterwards, discuss these questions with the class: Did the object do what you predicted? What shapes are the Objects That Rolled? What shapes are the Objects That Slid? Students will discover that a round, or nearly round, profile is necessary for rolling. To assess for understanding of how shape can predict movement, ask the students to draw a picture of one object in the room that would roll down the ramp and one that would slide down.Juliana Texley, lead reviewer for NSTA Recommends, shares a few favorite resources about simple machines and design technology. Books for elementary physical science are hard to find, and those with accurate language and illustrations even harder. Here are a few that have been recognized as outstanding.I Fall Down. Vicki Cobb. 2004. HarperCollins.This visually appealing and conceptually sound physical science book introduces young children to the concepts of gravity and weight. The concepts are reinforced through many real-life examples and fun activities that could easily be duplicated in class or at home.I began to understand in more depth the idea of social engagement at the computer when a college student from the local university sat with a student and talked about and pointed to the images on the screen as the student controlled the mouse. Taking their picture and later asking the student to tell me a story or what she sees sealed my belief that computer use can be beneficial.Have students remove one shoe and sock and look at their foot and describe it, either verbally or in writing. Prompt students with questions such as, How many toes do you have? What can you do with your toes? Can you hold a crayon or scratch an itch with your toes? What part of your foot touches the floor when you walk, tiptoe, or jump?Spread newspapers on the floor and have a stack of paper towels nearby for cleanup so children can wipe the paint off their own foot. Have some students, one at a time, put one foot into paint and then step onto a piece of paper. Have them repeat the printmaking on tiptoe. Invite other students to step into playdough and make imprints of their foot. Have them repeat the imprint making on tiptoe.One Small Place in a Tree. Barbara Brenner. 2004. HarperCollins.Reading this history of a hole in a tree invites us to imagine all of the plants and animals that may have lived in and drawn life from the tree, even after it has died.Teachers do not control the food that is purchased or prepared for their students, and we are usually not in a position to offer teeth brushing in the classroom. So, what can we do to influence our students? food choices and dental health? As science educators we can encourage investigations and teach information that can be used in supporting good dental health.When is the moment that a seed sprouts, or sediment accumulates, or a cavity has eaten into a tooth? It is difficult for young children to grasp that the cumulative effect of many small changes over time can be significant. Watching the change in eggshells over time as they sit in a bath of vinegar can help children accept that hard materials can indeed be damaged by a small daily change.Introduce the terms incisor, canine, premolar (bicuspid), and molar. View a diagram of human teeth and have the children point to the different types of teeth, especially if they are unable to draw teeth well enough to depict recognizable differences between them.Wilburn Elementary Tooth Tally Projecthttp://wilburnes.wcpss.net/tooth.htmFirst graders from around the world tally how many teeth are lost each month in their classes. In its eighth year, the project runs from February through April. The site also offers lesson ideas to integrate science with the rest of the curriculum and links to other dental sites.The University of Michigan Dentistry Librarywww.lib.umich.edu/dentlib/about/exhibits/kidsThis site offers suggestions on what to look for in a book about dental health and lists books that are accurate and reflect what the dental profession might say.Sometimes parents need to be nudged and reminded of examples of healthy snacks to send to school. Teachers can send home a list of appropriate snacks and post it on their website or include it in weekly newsletters. Suggestions could be a small sandwich, fresh fruit, animal crackers, fig newtons, granola bars, fruit juice, water, and nuts. Be aware of students who have peanut allergies. Ask parents to stay away from cake, cookies, puffy chips, roll ups, donuts, etc. As an extension, teachers can bring in the topic of dental care and brushing teeth. Perhaps some of you have students that keep a toothbrush at school to practice good dental hygiene during the school day? Everyone needs a reminder once in awhile.Chemistry explorations in early childhood classrooms often involve baking, mixing, or dissolving, during which students predict outcomes and try to replicate the results. The objective is to help students come to understand that even though we cannot see what is happening to cause a change, we can see that the change happens every time we follow a certain procedure.Using nonstandard units to measure is appropriate for young children whose knowledge of number symbols and fine-motor skills are not developed well enough to ',

        text: "In terms of sober historical scholarship the greatest value of the concept has been that of a heuristic device leading to important corrections of received ideas. It is itself now subject to serious criticism.Civic humanism is generally taken as an equivalent or as a particular variant of republicanism, meaning a conception of politics in which government is in principle the common business of the citizens. The city provides the environment -- a public space -- for human fulfillment. If, on the one hand, the republic is contrasted to personal or authoritarian government it also differs from the liberal model in which the constitution provides a formal frame that embraces citizens of diverse moral character and with varied individual pursuits. The republic rests rather on the virtues of its citizens and is oriented toward the common good. The virtues of citizenship are in turn developed and enhanced by being exercised in upholding republican political and legal institutions and making them work by being involved in their operation. Republican life is then thought to be formative of the public spirit on which it rests. Republican freedom depends on constant civic activity. The polity is taken to cohere by means of the common acceptance of standards of justice that are more than procedural rules. The purpose of the commonwealth is not so much peace and ensuring the rights of individuals, as the realization of human potentiality, which is taken to be essentially political. The republic is the necessary medium of self-realization, not merely the condition of possibility of private endeavors. Indeed, a certain amount of conflict, properly contained, adds to the liveliness and vigor of the republic. There is a link furthermore between the freedom of the citizen and the independence of the republic. Citizen armies and the right to bear arms are therefore common postulates of republican theory.Civic humanism is linked in principle to a classical educational program that goes beyond the formative capacity of participatory citizenship itself and involves the conscious revival of ancient ideals. How true this is of the educational practice of late Atlantic epigones of the republican tradition is a different matter. Republican candor, simplicity of manner, opposition to ostentation, luxury and lucre, are common, though not universal republican themes. Some theorists also dwell on the millenarian aspirations associated with republican ideals responding to the fragility of the republic and the need to provide against its corruption and decay with the passage of time.The concept was first used to characterize a cluster of historical phenomena of Renaissance Florence. It was then extended to mark a republican tradition or political language reaching back to classical antiquity. It finally came to indicate a political ideal opposed to both classical liberal and authoritarian views of politics.Its adoption by historians of ideas is linked with particular ways of doing history, first in the context of German historicist Geisteswissenschaften, then in connection with the methods developed by the ‘Cambridge School’, centered on the reconstruction of political discourses, exemplified by John Pocock and Quentin Skinner. It is by means of the latter reception that civic humanism entered the discussion about the intellectual origins of political currents in civil war England and pre-revolutionary America.Beyond seeking to identify the character of a particular time and place, Baron studied the political culture of Renaissance Florence as an instance of a transhistorically exemplary mode of communal existence pertinent, not least, to his own times. Florentine civic humanism represented for him, furthermore, a decisive turning point in history.For him it was an epochal event that, by looking backward to antiquity pointed forward to modernity, which he embraced wholeheartedly, without the misgivings of a Jacob Burckhardt or a Max Weber, as a liberating, civilizing, progressive process. The advent of civic humanism marked for Baron the victory of secular economic, social, and political ideals versus the asceticism, religious obscurantism, and hierarchy of the Middle Ages. Civic humanism provided the vital vehicle for the translation of the exalted ancient idea of citizenship to the modern age. The humanist defense of republican liberty against monarchical tyranny announced for him the beginnings of modern democratic thought, elevated by an educational ideal of classical inspiration, and accompanied by a renewed cultural creativity. It was thus the harbinger of the unequivocally positive trends in European civilization. The value of such achievements appeared all the more compelling since they were not theoretical postulates derived from abstract speculation but represented historically realized exempla.Baron's reconstruction of civic humanism was not only directed against other-worldly values and notions of medieval deference, but also against different modes of construing modern autonomy. He sought in particular to revise Burckhardt's reading of Renaissance individualism as morally ambiguous, manifested not in the form of able and accomplished humanists who were present in the courts of tyrants and in the Papal administration, as much as in republican states such as Venice and Florence. Baron was no less opposed to the claims advanced by Ernst Kantorowicz and others about the modernity of the autocratic state of Frederic II, that were so difficult to square with a liberal and optimistically progressive view of history. That other reading of early modernity yielded antecedents not of enlightened ‘western-oriented’ democratic citizenship, but of ‘Nietschean’ antibourgeois individualism, in tune with antidemocratic ideological tendencies in German culture of the Weimar period, including the ‘high’ culture of the circle of Stephan George, and very much at odds with Baron's political convictions. What was at issue here, beyond the characterization of a historical period, was the definition and evaluation of modernity itself.Baron wished to see the autonomous humanity he perceived emerging in quatrocento Florence integrated within a constitutional frame and anchored by patriotic attachment to the community. Baron's vast and only partly realized program to establish the Italian humanist tradition as a major source of modernity was deliberately juxtaposed to yet another tendency in German scholarship that sought the roots of modernity and modernization in Protestantism. Baron's emphasis on Florence was meant to counterbalance the ‘northern’ perspective of scholars such as Max Weber, Werner Sombart, and Baron's own mentor Ernst Troeltsch who, in their different ways, linked Protestantism and capitalism and saw the soul-searching subjectivity of Calvinist inspiration as a decisive moment in the genesis of modern individualism. Baron's historical project was inscribed in his advocacy of constitutional democracy on the West European and American model opposed to romantic nativist-Germanic notions for the Weimar republic.This orientation was affected for him, however, by the German intellectual tradition, for the exemplary polities were conceived not as formal frames of individual pursuits, but on the pattern of human autonomy woven into Sittlichkeit, the moral-cultural substance of German idealism. If this nexus of public solidarity be translated as civil society it should be evident why Baron's thesis should appeal to English-speaking communitarians. Yet, naturally, nuances change with every transfer.Baron's principled opposition to German nationalism and its threat to the republican order was itself deeply affected by archetypes of the German intellectual tradition. An important and recurring theme is the awakening of patriotic citizenship, heightened by the lessons drawn from a classical education, in response to the aggression of a foreign despot. The subtitle of Baron's Crisis is telling in this regard: Civic Humanism and Republican Liberty in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny. As Riccardo Fubini has pointed out, although Baron stated that his book was inspired by the struggle of the western democracies against Hitlerian tyranny, the pattern was already set well before the coming to power of the Nazis, preformed by the inflections of German idealism. In this scheme the Visconti of Milan are implicitly a prefiguration of Bonaparte.Baron's thesis has been criticized for neglecting political, institutional, and social history, in favor of identifying a pattern of consciousness as the decisive character of the political and historical phenomenon under study. It is true that Baron weaves together a way of life, an educational ideal, and the power of the state as an encompassing culture, that can be reconstructed as such in terms of Geistesgeschichte, the history of the spirit, by selecting from the evidence the materials needed for its purposes.The psychological motivation for Baron's emphasis on the integration of the individual in the politically structured community may perhaps be connected to his situation as an assimilated Jew in Weimar Germany.Driven into exile when Hitler came to power he was destined to experience the challenge of integration in a new country that was not insignificantly perhaps, a republic at war with tyranny: the United States.According to Gilbert's perspective the language of civic humanism was not only a means of expression but also an instrument of power of the elites (such as the group that met in the Rucellai gardens) who articulated it.Renaissance merchants was an essential component of the epochal turn towards the active life and, as he writes on the first page of the Crisis, linked to the rise of a bourgeois society, Gilbert emphasized instead the opposition between acquisitiveness and patriotism, calling attention to the calls to sacrifice and self-denial in favor of the common good f",

        text: "The CHA sets out a consultation process that must be undertaken with the province or territory before discretionary penalties can be levied. To date, the discretionary penalty provisions of the Act have not been applied.In addition to the medically necessary insured hospital and physician services covered by the CHA, provinces and territories also provide a range of programs and services outside the scope of the Act. These are provided at provincial and territorial discretion, on their own terms and conditions, and vary from one province or territory to another. Additional services that may be provided include pharmacare, ambulance services and optometric services.The additional services provided by provinces and territories may be targeted to specific population groups (e.g., children, seniors or social assistance recipients), and may be partially or fully covered by provincial and territorial health insurance plans.A number of services provided by hospitals and physicians are not considered medically necessary and thus, are not insured under provincial and territorial health insurance legislation. Uninsured hospital services for which patients may be charged include preferred hospital accommodation unless prescribed by a physician, private duty nursing services, and the provision of telephones and televisions. Uninsured physician services for which patients may be charged include telephone advice, the provision of medical certificates required for work, school, insurance purposes and fitness clubs, testimony in court and cosmetic services.The CHA definition of \"insured person\" excludes members of the Canadian Forces, persons appointed to a position of rank within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, persons serving a prison term in a federal penitentiary, and persons who have not completed a minimum period of residence in a province or territory (a period that must not exceed three months). In addition, the definition of \"insured health services\" excludes services to persons provided under any other Act of Parliament (e.g., foreign refugees) or under the workers' compensation legislation of a province or territory.There are two key policy statements that clarify the federal position on the CHA . These statements have been made in the form of ministerial letters from former federal Ministers responsible for health, to their provincial and territorial counterparts.In June 1985, approximately one year following the passage of the CHA in Parliament, Jake Epp, the federal minister responsible for Health at the time, wrote to his provincial and territorial counterparts to set out and confirm the federal position on the interpretation and implementation of the CHA.Minister Epp's letter followed several months of consultation with his provincial and territorial counterparts. The letter sets forth statements on the federal policy intent, which clarify the criteria, conditions and regulatory provisions of the CHA. These clarifications have been used by the federal government in assessing and interpreting compliance with the Act. The Epp letter continues to be an important reference for interpreting the Act.Between February 1994 and December 1994, a series of seven federal-provincial-territorial meetings dealing wholly or in part with private clinics took place. At issue was the growth of private clinics providing medically necessary services funded partially by the public system and partially by patients and its impact on Canada's universal, publicly funded health care system.At the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Health Ministers Meeting of September 1994 in Halifax, all ministers of health present, except for Alberta's health minister, agreed to \"take whatever steps are required to regulate the development of private clinics in Canada.\"On January 6, 1995, Diane Marleau, the federal minister responsible for Health, wrote to all provincial and territorial ministers of health, to announce the new Federal Policy on Private Clinics. The Minister's letter provided the federal interpretation of the CHA as it relates to the issue of facility fees charged directly to patients receiving medically necessary services at private clinics. The letter stated that the definition of \"hospital\" contained in the CHA, includes any public facility that provides acute, rehabilitative or chronic care. Thus, when a provincial or territorial health insurance plan pays the physician fee for a medically necessary service delivered at a private clinic, it must also pay the facility fee or face a deduction from federal transfer payments.In April 2002, the then-federal Health Minister A. Anne McLellan outlined in a letter to her provincial and territorial counterparts a Canada Health Act Dispute Avoidance and Resolution process, which was agreed to by provinces and territories, except Quebec. The process meets federal, provincial and territorial interests of avoiding disputes related to the interpretation of CHA principles, and when this is not possible, resolving disputes in a fair, transparent and timely manner.The process includes the dispute avoidance activities of government-to-government information exchange; discussions and clarification of issues, as they arise; active participation of governments in ad hoc federal-provincial-territorial committees on Canada Health Act issues; and Canada Health Act advance assessments, upon request.Where dispute avoidance activities are unsuccessful, dispute resolution activities may be initiated, beginning with government-to-government fact-finding and negotiations. If these are unsuccessful, either Minister of Health involved may refer the issues to a third-party panel to undertake fact-finding and provide advice and recommendations.The federal Minister of Health has the final authority to interpret and enforce the CHA. In deciding whether to invoke the non-compliance provisions of the Act, the Minister will take the panel's report into consideration.In administering the Canada Health Act (CHA), the federal Minister of Health is assisted by Health Canada policy, communications and information officers located in Ottawa and in the six regional offices of the Department, and by lawyers with the Department of Justice.Health Canada takes its responsibilities under the CHA seriously, working with the provinces and territories to ensure that the principles of the CHA are respected. Our preference is always to work with provinces and territories to resolve issues through consultation, collaboration and cooperation.The within-Canada portability provisions of the CHA are implemented through a series of bilateral reciprocal billing agreements between provinces and territories for hospital and physician services. This generally means that a patient's health card will be accepted, in lieu of payment, when the patient receives hospital or physician services in another province or territory. The province or territory providing the service will then directly bill the patient's home province. All provinces and territories participate in reciprocal hospital agreements and all, with the exception of Quebec, participate in reciprocal medical agreements. The intent of these agreements is to ensure that Canadian residents do not face point-of-service charges for medically required hospital and physician services when they travel in Canada. However, these agreements are interprovincial/territorial and signing them is not a requirement of the CHA.Health Canada's approach to resolving possible CHA compliance issues emphasizes transparency, consultation and dialogue with provincial and territorial health ministry officials. In most instances, issues are successfully resolved through consultation and discussion based on a thorough examination of the facts. Deductions have only been applied when all options to resolve the issue have been exhausted. To date, most disputes and issues related to administering and interpreting the CHA have been addressed and resolved without resorting to deductions.Health Canada officials routinely liaise with provincial and territorial health ministry representatives and health insurance plan administrators to help resolve common problems experienced by Canadians related to eligibility for health insurance coverage and portability of health services within and outside Canada.The Canada Health Act Division and regional office staff monitor the operations of provincial and territorial health care insurance plans in order to provide advice to the Minister on possible non-compliance with the CHA. Sources for this information include: provincial and territorial government officials and publications; media reports; and correspondence received from the public and other non-government organizations. Staff in the Compliance and Interpretation Unit, Canada Health Act Division, assess issues of concern and complaints on a case-by-case basis. The assessment process involves compiling all facts and information related to the issue and taking appropriate action. Verifying the facts with provincial and territorial health officials may reveal issues that are not directly related to the CHA, while others may pertain to the CHA but are a result of misunderstanding or miscommunication, and are resolved quickly with provincial assistance. In instances where a CHA issue has been identified and remains after initial enquiries, Division officials then ask the jurisdiction in question to investigate the matter and report back. Division staff, then discuss the issue and its possible resolution with provincial officials. Only if the issue is not resolved to the satisfaction of the Division after following the aforementioned steps, is it brought to the attention of the federal Minister of Health.No new CHA compliance issues arose during 2004-2005. With respect to compliance issues noted in previous years, other than specific developments noted below, bilateral communications on these issues are ongoing.This informati",
